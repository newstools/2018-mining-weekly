PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Gold developer Barra Resources has tipped the historic Main Lode gold mine as its priority exploration target for 2018. Forming part of its greater Burbanks gold project, the Main Lode underground mine was abandoned at the start of World War One, and has not been mined since. Between 1885 and 1914, the mine produced some 85 900 oz of gold. Barra will now conduct a 4 000 m reverse circulation drilling programme, which will start next week, following up on drilling results from 2017. The ASX-listed junior recently completed a geological assessment and strategic review of its gold portfolio, which resulted in an update to its gold strategy. The new strategy was based on an initial exploration target of between 223 000 oz and 564 000 oz of gold at the Burbanks project alone.
