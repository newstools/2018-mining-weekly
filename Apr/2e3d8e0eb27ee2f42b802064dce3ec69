LONDON – The Alouette aluminium smelter in Canada, the biggest in the Americas, does not plan to declare force majeure, a spokesperson said on Wednesday, denying a market rumour. There was speculation in the market that Alouette may have to take the measure due to a shortage of raw material alumina. "We have not declared force majeure and we do not intend to declare it either," a spokesperson told Reuters. The operation has an annual capacity of 600 000 t of primary aluminium, according to its website. The smelter is owned by a consortium, with 40% owned by Rio Tinto, 20% stakes held by both AMAG Austria Metall AG and Norsk Hydro, 13.3% by Japan's Marubeni and 6.7% by Investissement Québec.
