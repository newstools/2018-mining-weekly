VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) – The LSE-listed equity of Hochschild Mining has reported higher first-quarter production than expected compared to the year-earlier period, as record output at Inmaculada mine, as well as a strong result from Pallancata buoyed output – both located in Peru. During the three months ended March, Hochschild reported attributable production of 9.8-million ounces of silver equivalent, or 132 036 oz of gold equivalent ounces. This compared with attributable output of 8.6-million ounces of silver equivalent, or 116 000 oz of gold equivalent in the comparable year-earlier period. "Hochschild has delivered a strong start to the year with better than expected contributions from Inmaculada and Pallancata and our other mines performing as planned. We are therefore firmly on track to meet our stated production and cost targets for 2018,” CEO Ignacio Bustamante said in a statement. Hochschild, which also operates the San José mine in joint-venture with McEwen Mining, reiterated its 2018 guidance of 38-million ounces of silver equivalent, or 514 000 oz of gold equivalent. The company expects all-in sustaining costs to come in between $960/oz to $990/oz of gold, or $13/oz to $13.40/oz silver equivalent. The company has also embarked on an ambitious brownfield exploration plan with campaigns already started at Inmaculada, Arcata and San Jose, which it expects could deliver resource additions to the mineral base during 2018. The miner’s LSE-quoted stock gained early 10% on Wednesday to 219.7 pence apiece.
