JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – The De Beers Group has launched its Forevermark diamond brand in Indonesia. For the market launch, Forevermark will partner with Indonesia’s premier jewellery company, Central Mega Kencana (CMK). Forevermark will initially be sold in 12 stores in the CMK network in the Jakarta region, with plans to expand further in the near future. The Indonesia launch means Forevermark will now be available in 26 markets globally. “Forevermark’s brand promise continues to resonate very strongly across the world, and we look forward to exploring the potential for further new market launches as the brand goes from strength to strength,” Forevermark CEO Steven Lussier said in a statement on Thursday.
