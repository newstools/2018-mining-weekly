SANTIAGO â€“ Caserones copper mine, in Chile, said on Tuesday that it would temporarily shut down its copper concentrator in order to replace a leaking pipe. The Environmental Tribunal of Antofagasta, a province of Chile's northern mining region, asked Lumina Copper, which owns the mine, to shut down the processing plant for 15 days following a tailings spill into a nearby river, Caserones said in a statement. Caserones said in a statement the rest of the mine remained in operation.
