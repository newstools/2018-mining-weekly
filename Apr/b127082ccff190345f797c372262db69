JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – The Kiziltepe joint venture (JV) mine, in which Aim-listed Ariana Resources holds 50%, lifted its first-quarter production by 8% quarter-on-quarter to 4 866 oz, augmented by an increase in gold recovery from the processing plant. The JV with Proccea Construction, in Turkey, mined 68 600 t of ore, at an average mined grade of 4.5 g/t of gold – a 37% increase in tonnes and a 32% increase in grade quarter-on-quarter. The plant throughput totalled 44 897 t of ore, at average head grade of 3.85 g/t of gold. This compares with fourth-quarter throughput of 45 381 t, at a plant feed grade of 3.79 g/t. The average metallurgical plant recovery of gold for the quarter was 95.1% - a 4% quarter-on-quarter increase in gold recovery from the processing plant. “The performance on Kiziltepe continues to exceed feasibility expectations and this quarter marks a solid start to 2018. During the current quarter, we expect output to increase further, based on our 2018 mining schedule and particularly as we start to access higher grade areas of the Arzu South vein,” said Ariana MD Dr Kerim Sener. The JV has a full-year production guidance of 20 000 oz of gold.
