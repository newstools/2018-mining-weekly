PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed Mineral Resources (MinRes) has warned shareholders that production at the Wodgina direct shipping ore (DSO) lithium project, in Western Australia, will be less than expected. The miner on Wednesday noted that a number of adverse weather events, some mechanical failures as well as port congestion during the first quarter of 2018 had impacted the DSO lithium exports from Wodgina. Based on its current estimates, MinRes expected lithium exports to be some 10% below the 4.5-million tonnes previously guided. Meanwhile, the sales price for the spodumene concentrate from the Mt Marion lithium operation has been revised up from $900/t to $950/t. The new price will be effective for the balance of this financial year. MinRes has again confirmed its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization guidance of more than A$500-million for the full financial year.
