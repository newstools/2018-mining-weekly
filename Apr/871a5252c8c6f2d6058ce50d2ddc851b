VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) – Mining giant Rio Tinto has become the first company in the world to be certified under the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) – a new benchmark for healthy environmental, social and governance practices across the aluminium lifecycle of production, use and recycling, the company announced on Tuesday. By using ASI certified aluminium, manufacturers and end users will now be able to demonstrate their commitment to a sustainable supply chain. "We expect responsible aluminium production will become increasingly important for our customers and the consumers who buy their products,” said Rio Tinto Aluminium CEO Alf Barrios. Two of Rio Tinto Aluminium’s most prominent aluminium customers include Swiss-based Nespresso and German automaker Audi. The certification follows an independent third-party audit and covers a range of operations across the aluminium value chain, from bauxite mining to alumina refining, aluminium smelting, the creation of value-added products, transformation and recycling, and associated activities. Rio Tinto's five aluminium smelters, the Vaudreuil refinery, casting and spent potlining treatment centres and associated infrastructure such as power, port and railway facilities in Quebec, Canada have been certified, along with the Gove bauxite mine, in Australia. Rio Tinto has committed to work with the ASI on audits and certifications for other sites in its global aluminium business. "We expect to see growing demand for ASI certified products from end users and customers seeking to demonstrate a responsible supply chain," Rio Tinto Aluminium VP for sales and marketing and ASI board member Tolga Egrilmezer added.
