JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Dual-listed Atalaya Mining has achieved its second highest production quarter on record, with copper output increasing to 9 441 t in the three months ended March, from 8 805 t in the corresponding period of 2017. The company, which operates the Proyetco Riotinto mine, in Spain, achieved a 7.1% year-on-year improvement in production and a 9.5% quarter-on-quarter improvement. Ore milled remained consistent with previous quarters, while the head grade improved from 0.44% in the fourth quarter to 0.48% in the first quarter. Atalaya attributed the increase in copper production to a record average recovery rate of 88.47% in the period under review. "It has been a strong operational quarter for the company, with reported production figures ahead of internal expectations,” CEO Alberto Lavandeira said on Wednesday, reaffirming the company’s full-year production guidance of 37 000 t to 40 000 t. The Proyecto Riotinto expansion project, which will increase the mine’s capacity to 15-million tonnes a year, is progressing according to plan, with the overall progress completion at 27%. Civil engineering works at the new concentrate handling area are well advanced and earthworks at the flotation area are progressing according to plan. The expansion project will achieve mechanical completion by the middle of next year. Atalaya is also continuing with permitting work at the Proyecto Touro project. A prefeasibility study is to be released in the current quarter.
