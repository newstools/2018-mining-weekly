JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed IronRidge Resources’ joint venture (JV) with Joy Transporters over the Saltpond and Cape Coast projects, in Ghana, has been finalised. Joy Transporters is a Ghanaian company and the registered licence holder of the Saltpond licence and the Cape Coast project licence application. The JV provides IronRidge with additional highly prospective tenure over 318 km2 that further complements the company’s lithium portfolio in neighbouring Côte d’Ivoire. The newly acquired licences are adjacent to the Ewoyaa prospect, where earthworks are currently under way and drilling imminent, within the broader Cape Coast lithium project area, in Ghana. IronRidge CEO Vincent Mascolo said the addition of these strategic and highly prospective licences to the company’s lithium portfolio dovetails nicely into its advancing lithium portfolio in Ghana, where IronRidge sees potential in the stored energy space and beyond. The IronRidge lithium portfolio in Ghana includes the historical Egyasimanku Hill spodumene-rich lithium resource, estimated to contain about 1.48-million tonnes at 1.67% lithium and surrounding tenements, in which the company has entered into earn-in arrangements with Obotan Minerals, Merlink Resources, Barari Developments and Joy Transporters.
