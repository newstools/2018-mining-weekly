JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-quoted Savannah Resources has discovered new high-grade lithium mineralisation at its Mina do Barroso project, in Portugal, where it believes the Grandoa deposit offers a significant near-term lithium development. The new mineralisation was discovered to the west and southwest of the main Grandao deposit and has been named Grandao Extended. Drilling to date at Grandao Extended has defined a zone of pegmatite about 300 m long and 200 m wide, confirming the potential of the zone. "We are delighted with the consistently excellent results we are seeing from the drilling of the Grandao system. The main Grandao deposit already extends over a large area of 400 m north-south and 330 m east-west. Grandao Extended is adding to this with a 30 0 m extension to the southwest which suggests that much of the exploration target in this area has the potential to be converted to additional mineral resource. "It is particularly encouraging to see the excellent grades being reported as we believe this will only add to the economic appeal of a mine development at Grandao, which already benefits from near surface mineralisation which should be able to be mined with a very low stripping ratio,” commented CEO David Archer. Drill testing results include 90 m at 0.96% lithium oxide (Li2O) from surface, including 31 m at 1.06% Li2O from surface and 34 m at 1.37% Li2O from 50 m in 18GRARC65, 31 m at 1.52% Li2O from 47 m in 18GRARC63, 18 m at 1.52% Li2O from 24 m in 18GRARC50 and 25 m at 1.27% Li2O from 34 m in 18GRARC53. Archer said that the Hatch scoping study would be completed towards the end of the second quarter of 2018, together with a further mineral resource update. A total of 120 holes for 9 600 m drilled have been completed to date as part of the ongoing reverse circulation drill programme across three primary Mina do Barroso targets, including Grandao, Reservatorio and NOA.
