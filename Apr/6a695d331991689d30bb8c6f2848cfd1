PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior miner Malachite Resources at the end of March poured its first gold from the Lorena gold mine, in north-west Queensland. “We are delighted to have achieved this significant step in the development of the Lorena gold project and to have also achieved gold producer status for the first time since listing on the ASX,” said Malachite chairperson Terry Cuthbertson. The first gold poured was sourced from lower grade ore that was processed while the plant processes and recoveries were being optimised in order to achieve steady-state production. Cuthbertson said that the processing of higher-grade ore through the processing plant had now started, and gold production was expected on a regular basis. Lorena is expected to produce between 30 000 oz and 35 000 oz in its 18-month project life from an opencut operation.
