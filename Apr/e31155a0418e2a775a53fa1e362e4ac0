JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed IronRidge Resource has received the necessary approvals and earthworks have started for drill access and drill pads over its Ewoyaa pegmatite deposit, in Ghana. Earthworks are expected to take between two and three weeks to complete. The company plans to undertake about 7 000 m of reverse circulation and diamond drilling for up to 60 holes over two phases, starting in late April or early May. Ewoyaa’s geology comprises three well-defined pegmatite zones with a combined 1 600 m strike length, with the largest single spodumene-bearing pegmatite being over 800 m long and up to 90 m wide at surface. IronRidge previously reported high-grade lithium results at Ewoyaa from surface trenching, including 65 m at 1.1% lithium, 25 m at 1.62% lithium, 18 m at 1.75% lithium, and 4.5 m at 2.2% lithium. IronRidge CEO Vincent Mascolo said the approvals to start earthworks and drilling is the next crucial step in confirming Ewoyaa as a significant lithium discovery.
