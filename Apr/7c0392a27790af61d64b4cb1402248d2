JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed African Battery Metals (ABM) has extended the auger programme on its Kisinka property, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The extension will allow the miner to investigate additional soil anomalies. Two lines of augering have been completed to date, one across the southeastern part of the 8-km-long licence and the second towards the northwestern part of the licence. “Given positive indications from the northern auger line, we have decided to extend the auger programme and we plan to submit samples for laboratory analysis in Johannesburg shortly,” CEO Roger Murphy said in a statement on Thursday. The augering penetrates the surface to extract soil samples from closer to the bedrock, which is useful in areas of soil cover like Kisinka. Given the large size of the licence, and the distance between the two lines of augering, consideration will also be given to running a soil sampling programme on a grid pattern across the whole area. While the current exploration focus is on Kisinka, the team continues to evaluate other copper/cobalt opportunities in the DRC, and retains the option over a second licence, Sakania. "The next round of field work on Kisinka, which could involve soil sampling or further augering, will be formulated based on ongoing results,” Murphy said.
