JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Phase 2 drilling at Thani Stratex Resources’ (TSR’s) Pandora gold project, in Djibouti, found an “outstanding” intersection of gold on the previously untested Pyrrha vein. Aim-listed Stratex International, which owns 30.4% of TSR, on Thursday said the aim of the drilling was to test the depth-extension of previously drilled mineralisation and to identify potential higher-grade ore shoots within the system. The Phase 2 diamond drilling was completed for 3 036 m in 18 holes, with best drill results including 8.30 m at 7.21 g/t gold from 144.55 m, including 0.08 m at 26.10 g/t gold; and 10 m at 1.20 g/t gold from 130 m, including 5.85 m at 1.90 g/t gold. Additionally, the drilling results found 35.07 m at 1.28 g/t gold from 109.55 m, including 9.80 m at 3.06 g/t gold and 2.40 m at 1.75 g/t gold; 1.10 m at 5.10 g/t gold from 42 m, including 0.50 m at 9.91 g/t gold; and 1.22 m at 55.40 g/t gold from 50.3 m; as well as 3.54 m at 2.35 g/t of gold from 100.4 m. Stratex CEO Tim Livesey commented that the current drilling phase at the Pandora gold project continued to show promising intersects. The Pyrrha vein, though narrow on surface, has been mapped for over 400 m and will be an important focus for additional drill testing. However, TSR will undertake preliminary metallurgical test work ahead of the next phase of drilling.
