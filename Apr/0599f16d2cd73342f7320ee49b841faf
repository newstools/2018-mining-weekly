PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining major BHP has taken the decision to discontinue its membership of the World Coal Association (WCA), citing “material differences” in their respective climate change policies. The diversified giant also said on Thursday that the decision was also taken in light of the “narrow range of activities of benefit” to the company from membership of the WCA. BHP’s decision followed an industry association review, which was published in December last year. The review focused on 21 industry associations assessed as holding an active position on climate change and energy policy, as well as ten climate and energy policies that were identified as being of key importance to BHP’s position strategy and policy advocacy. The review raised seven material differences on climate and energy policy across three industry associations, including the WCA, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA). BHP said that the updated Energy and Climate Policy Position, released by the MCA in March, was aligned with BHP’s own approach to climate and energy policy. The new policy also addressed the two areas identified by BHP’s review as material differences to the company, which meant that BHP would maintain its membership with the MCA. Furthermore, the mining major would also maintain its membership of the US Chamber of Commerce, saying that while the material differences identified by the review remained in place, the company derived a range of benefits from the broader activities of the chamber. BHP said that the chamber had also indicated its willingness to engage further with the company on climate and energy issues, offering BHP a position on its Energy and Environment Committee. The miner said that it would work with the chamber, and its wider membership, on the direction of the chamber’s climate and energy policy by actively participating in the Energy and Environment Committee.
