PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) has reported a 28% decline in production during the March quarter of 2018, compared with the previous three months. ERA reported production of 442 t of uranium oxide from its Ranger operation, in the Northern Territory, which was also 26% below the previous corresponding period. Production during the March quarter was impacted by mill maintenance, declining grades and weather events, the miner told shareholders, adding that higher-grade laterite stocks were now substantially exhausted, in line with the mine plan. Continued uranium production will be based on the processing of primary ore stockpiles. For the full 2018, ERA was expecting to produce between 1 600 t and 2 000 t of uranium oxide.
