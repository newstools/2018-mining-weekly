JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – The first KwaZulu-Natal Mining Summit will be held on April 18 and will officially be opened by Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe. The summit, which will be held at Blackrock Garden Court, in Newcastle, is aimed at ensuring a more rapid inclusion of black Africans and emerging industrialists in the mining sector and mining industry value chain, the Department of Mineral Resources said in a statement issued on Thursday. “My department has identified the mining sector as an industry that has the potential not only to create jobs but also to develop industrialists, enhance the development of the small, medium-sized and microenterprise sector and to stimulate beneficiation and entrepreneurship among the previously disenfranchised,” added KwaZulu-Natal economic development, tourism and environmental affairs MEC Sihle Zikalala.
