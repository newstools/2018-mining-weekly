PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold explorer Oklo Resources will raise A$15-million through a share placement to accelerate exploration activities at its gold projects in Mali. The miner on Thursday told shareholders that it had received strong commitments from sophisticated and institutional investors to subscribe for 39.47-million shares, at a price of 38c each. The raising was oversubscribed with strong demand from both existing shareholders and new institutional investors. “This capital raising places Oklo in a strong financial position allowing us to continue our aggressive drilling activities at the Seko discovery and other priority targets along the 12 km Dandoko gold corridor,” said Oklo MD Simon Taylor.
