PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Lithium Australia is recommissioning the cathode powder plant acquired through its recent takeover of technology company VSPC. The VSPC facility, which consists of a two- to four-tonne-a-year pilot plant, incorporates an integrated laboratory, coin-cell production facility and battery testing equipment. Lithium Australia said on Wednesday that since its takeover of VSPC in February, the company had undertaken time-critical service agreements, recruited technical and operating staff and arranged service agreements with universities to support the technical demands of the project. “Recommissioning of the VSPC pilot plant is a challenging task, but many of the past scientific and operating staff have made themselves available to ensure success,” said Lithium Australia MD Adrian Griffin. “We welcome their assistance and participation in our plan to provide the world’s best battery producers with the best available cathode materials.”
