JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Irish gold and zinc explorer Connemara Mining has announced a maiden inferred resource estimate at its Stonepark zinc project, in Limerick. The joint venture (JV) project between Group Eleven (76.56%) and Connemara (23.44%) has a mineral resource estimate of 5.3-million tonnes, grading 11.15% zinc and lead combined (8.55% zinc and 2.6% lead). “The work underlies Stonepark's status as an advanced project and as a key asset to the company.  This maiden mineral resource demonstrates attractive grades, but is also significant in terms of tonnage,” Connemara CEO Patrick Cullen said on Tuesday. Group Eleven commissioned the work on the Stonepark project based on drilling conducted by Connemara’s previous JV partner, Teck Resources. Cullen noted that the Stonepark deposit was first discovered in 2007, but that activity had been low in recent years. “It has been very encouraging to see the work recommence in earnest with Group Eleven's acquisition of Teck's share. Connemara continues to support the JV and looks forward to results from the drilling currently under way at Stonepark North." The deposit is relatively shallow, occurring at depths ranging from 190 m to 395 m. National Instrument 43-101-compliant resource was conducted by CSA Global in collaboration with SLR Consulting Ireland.
