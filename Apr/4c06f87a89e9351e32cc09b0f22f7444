JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed Beowulf has signed a graphite collaboration agreement with Åbo Akademi University, formalising an agreement that the company has forged with the university, in Turku, Finland, over several years. The agreement is focused on knowledge sharing, the identification of graphite prospects, their exploration, and development into production assets. "Åbo has deep experience of where to look for graphite in Finland and it gives us a head start when the company is selecting prospects to investigate,” Beowulf CEO Kurt Budge commented in a statement on Tuesday. Åbo Akademi’s Professor Olav Eklund said that the collaboration between the university and the mining company had given opportunities for students and researchers to work with Finnish graphite from exploration to nano technological research.

"So far, several potential areas of high-quality flake graphite have been identified and studied for graphene exfoliation." Natural graphite is one of the 20 most critical raw materials identified by the European Union, and the bed rock of Finland contains several potential areas for graphite exploration. Besides a graphite exploration portfolio in Finland, Beowulf is also focused on the Kallak magnetite iron-ore project and the Åtvidaberg polymetallic exploration licence in Sweden.
