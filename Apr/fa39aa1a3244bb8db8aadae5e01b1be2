JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Employees of Murray & Roberts Cementation (MRC) returned to work at platinum group metals producer Northam Platinum’s Booysendal North mine, on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, on Wednesday. The work stoppage by 750 MRC employees was announced on March 26. The return to work follows after an agreement was reached with the representative union Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union regarding end-of-term contract termination packages from MRC. The MRC employees had been approached by Northam to become full-time employees in a move for Booysendal to become an owner-operated mine, which would result in them becoming permanent Northam employees. The affected employees were then demanding end-of-contract termination packages from MRC. Both MRC and AMCU had been consulting with the affected employees, while MRC had applied for an urgent interdict to effect a return to work.
