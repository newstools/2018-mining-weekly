PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Troy Resources has reported record production at its Karouni operations, in Guyana, during the three months to March. The company told shareholders on Monday that the mine produced a record 21 703 oz during the March quarter, which was some 35% higher than the December quarter production of 16 109 oz, and 8% higher than the previous record quarterly production of 20 195 oz, which was achieved in the March quarter of 2016. “Excellent grades from the Smarts 3 pit, together with a strong performance by mining and processing have enabled the company to beat budget and set a record quarter of gold production for the Karouni project,” said Troy MD Ken Nilsson. “The production budget for future quarters is set at an amount slightly below that of this record quarter,” he added.
