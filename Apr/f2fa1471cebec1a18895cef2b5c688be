JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Asanko Gold’s Asanko mine, in Ghana, performed ahead of the optimised life-of-mine (LoM) plan during the first quarter ended March 31. The mine performed exceptionally well, said Asanko president and CEO Peter Breese, who noted that it is also ahead of plan on the key metrics of gold production, grade and mill throughput. The enlarged Nkran pushback is progressing ahead of schedule and the mill delivered another record milling throughput performance of 1.27-million tonnes, processing a monthly record of 432 410 t in March, which is, on an annualised basis, above the recently upgraded design of five-million tonnes a year. These results, he said, demonstrates the processing plant’s ability to sustain throughput at the newly upgraded levels. Quarterly gold production was 48 229 oz and gold sales were 48 899 oz. The results are very encouraging, Breese noted, and mean that the company is on track to meet its production guidance of 90 000 oz to 100 000 oz of gold for the first half of this year.
