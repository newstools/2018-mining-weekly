BAMAKO â€“ A workers' strike in Mali has halted gold production at two mines run by Randgold Resources since Wednesday, a senior union official told Reuters on Thursday. The strike at the Loulo and Gounkoto mines was related to the payment of bonuses and would continue until the issue was resolved, said Mamadou N'Daou, the administrative secretary of the industry and mines union SECNAMI.
