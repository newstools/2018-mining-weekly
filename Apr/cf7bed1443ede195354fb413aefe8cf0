JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) ­– Aim-listed Altus Strategies has reported further encouraging results from the recent exploration at its Daro licence, in northern Ethiopia. These include rock chip samples grading 24% copper, 1.19 g/t gold and 203 g/t gold and highly anomalous cobalt mineralisation, up to 496 ppm copper, along a 1.7 km stretch of the 2.5-km-long Teklil prospect. "We have also discovered the Wedihazo prospect, which hosts a discontinuous 250-m-long zone of in-situ copper mineralisation that is up to 15 m wide in places,” CEO Steven Poulton said in a statement on Thursday. Grab sampling at Wedihazo has returned assays including 1.69% copper and 1.72% copper. A float sample collected from a drainage channel 500 m downslope of Wedihazo returned 22.3% copper. Separately, results from the company's stream sediment sampling have been received. Two priority drainage basins have been defined and extensive artisanal gold workings have been mapped along a 9.5 km section of the Ilawit river. "The next phases of work at Daro will likely include mapping, soil sampling and ground magnetics across the areas prioritised from this programme of work." Follow-up exploration has been completed at the 2.5-km-long Teklil prospect focusing on previously observed artisanal workings and copper-bearing gossans - results included 7.51% copper, 3.09% copper and 2.79% copper, along with 1.01 g/t gold. In addition, a float sample yielded 34% copper and 0.54 g/t gold. A number of historic gold workings, as well as copper-bearing gossans, have been observed across an area of about 400 m by 400 m at Teklil. The prospect has also returned float samples with high silver assays, up to 203 g/t gold, as well as anomalous lead up to 0.7% lead.
