PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner St Barbara has reported a slight decline in gold production during the three months to March, owing to changes at the Gwalia mine sequence as the main south-west branch lode was prioritised. Gold production during the three months under review reached 85 885 oz, compared with the 99 509 oz produced in the previous quarter. The Gwalia mine delivered 56 773 oz in the March quarter, compared with the 62 835 oz delivered in the three months to December, while the Simberi mine delivered 29 112 oz in the third quarter, compared with the 36 674 oz in the second quarter. St Barbara said that the production at Simberi reflected lower gold grades during the quarter, as well as the loss of seven day’s worth of production owing to illegal work stoppages in early March. Looking ahead, the miner told shareholders that the Gwalia operation was expected to have a strong final quarter, as the mine sequence remained in higher-grade sections of the orebody, and the revised stoping front would provide more available stopes.

At the end of the March quarter, St Barbara had total cash at bank of A$262-million.
