DOUALA, Cameroon – Moroccan King Mohammed VI will sign a series of investment agreements in a visit to Congo Republic this weekend, Environment & Tourism Minister Arlette Soudan-Nonault said. Mohammed will travel to the Central African nation for an April 28 summit of leaders to discuss the Congo Basin Blue Fund, Soudan-Nonault said by mobile-phone text message on Thursday from the capital, Brazzaville. The monarch will meet Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso during the visit, she said.
