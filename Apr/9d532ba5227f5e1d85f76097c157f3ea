PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (PNG LNG) project has restarted production ahead of schedule, following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake in the country’s highlands in February. Project operator ExxonMobil reported on Friday that one train was currently operating at the LNG plant near Port Morseby, with the second train expected to restart as production was increased over time. “Resuming LNG production ahead of our projected eight-week timeframe is a significant achievement for ExxonMobil, our joint venture partners and our customers,” said ExxonMobil production company president Neil Duffin. “We will continue to support those communities impacted by the earthquake as we work towards fully restoring our operations.” Project partner Santos on Friday said that the restart of operations ahead of schedule was a major achievement by the operator. “Santos also looks forward to continuing to work with our local communities in Papua New Guinea who still have a long road to recovery following the loss of life, homes and crops caused by the earthquake,” said Santos MD and CEO Kevin Gallagher. During the period in which operations were shut down, some of the maintenance work at the LNG plant site, which had previously been scheduled for April and October, was completed. Planned modifications to the Hides gas conditioning plant, including some Angore tie-in work, were also brought forward.
