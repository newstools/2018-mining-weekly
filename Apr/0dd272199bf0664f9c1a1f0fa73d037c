JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Jubilee Metals set a new operational record when it produced 1 858 oz of platinum-group metals (PGMs), in March, while its unit cost reached a low of $434/oz for the first quarter ended March 31. “I am very pleased with the continued operational improvements at our Hernic operations. I expect the second quarter in 2018 to deliver even better operational numbers as the Hernic operation continues to improve,” commented Jubilee CE Leon Coetzer. He added that the company’s Dilokong Chrome Mine (DCM) operation is going through a transitional phase as the company gears up to execute the PGM project. “We have temporarily suspended the processing of third-party ore at DCM due to a continued variation in feed quality causing operational difficulties, which negatively impacts on our production of chrome from the on-site tailings and surface waste material,” he added. Coetzer, meanwhile, enthused that it is an exciting period for Jubilee as the company expands its operational reach. “Our projects team has a busy time ahead as we look to execute the PlatCro PGM project, DCM PGM project and the Kabwe project.” In addition, the Hernic operation continues to deliver improved results quarter-on-quarter. The company is gearing up to start construction on the DCM PGM recovery plant, with the project plant design target set at 25 000 t/m of feed material to the chrome and PGM recovery plant. Phase 1 of the fine chrome recovery circuit has been completed with the design and construction of an enlarged fine chrome recovery circuit to enhance the recovery of chrome prior to the recovery of the PGMs, under way.
