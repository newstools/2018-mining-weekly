JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed Bacanora Lithium is continuing to advance a feasibility study to demonstrate the economic viability of producing higher value lithium products at the Zinnwald project, in Germany, for the European battery and automotive sectors. The feasibility study is under way and is scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2019, says Bacanora, which last month delisted from the TSX-V and redomiciled to the UK. In a corporate update and project review, published on Wednesday, Bacanora said that assay results were being collated following the completion of the infill drilling programme in December. Work for the purposes of updating the resource estimate in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 would start in the current quarter and would be followed by mine design and mine planning activities. Bacanora said that work on the processing flow sheet had progressed through the crushing, grinding and magnetic separation stages and roasting testwork was now under way. “Once this work is completed, the metallurgical testwork will focus on the production of high-value downstream lithium products, facilitated by access to product reagents from the chemical industries located in Dresden,” the company stated. Bacanora owns 50% of the Zinnwald project, in southern Saxony.
