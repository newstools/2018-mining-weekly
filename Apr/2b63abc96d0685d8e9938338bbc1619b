PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Ramelius Resources on Monday reported record gold production from its Western Australian operations. The ASX-listed miner produced 58 671 oz of gold in the March quarter, exceeding its production guidance of between 54 000 oz and 58 000 oz. The March quarter results also trumped the 58 012 oz of gold produced in the previous quarter. The Mt Magnet operation produced 20 596 oz of gold during the quarter, while the Vivien operation contributed 13 792 oz and the Edna May mine 24 283 oz. “We are extremely pleased to see the operations team back up last quarter’s record production with another benchmark quarter, to consolidate Ramelius at a production run-rate in excess of 200 000 oz of gold per annum,” said Ramelius MD Mark Zeptner. “It was particularly encouraging to see production growth from our recently acquired Edna May operation, where we are looking at potentially large increases to the current ore reserve position by the middle of the calendar year. Of course, this is not forgetting the Mt Magnet/Vivien business unit, which has shown itself to be a reliable producer also with plenty of high-grade underground potential recently unearthed at Mt Magnet.” Ramelius’ group production for the year-to-date has also exceeded the guidance of between 133 000 oz and 145 000 oz, coming in at 149 833 oz. The miner has reaffirmed its full year targets of between 200 000 oz and 210 000 oz.
