PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior producer Blackham Resources has reported record gold production during the March quarter, as its Matilda-Wiluna operations, in Western Australia, accessed higher-grade ores. Gold production during the quarter reached 20 631 oz, which was up from the 14 922 oz delivered in the previous quarter, with the ASX-listed miner setting a production record for the month of March of 7 419 oz. “The March operational results demonstrate a continuation of the step change in project economics that commenced in December 2017. Record production and significantly reduced costs underpinned a quarter of strong operational cash flows, while building stockpiles,” said Blackham executive chairperson Milan Jerkovic. “We remain confident that 2018 will be a transformational year that will generate significant operating cash flows and value for Blackham and its shareholders.” All-in sustaining costs (AISC) for the quarter reduced to A$1 092/oz for the quarter, compared with the A$1 882/oz reported in the previous quarter. Looking ahead, Blackham has reaffirmed its production guidance of between 40 000 oz to 45 000 oz, and an AISC range of A$1 100/oz to A$1 200/oz for the first half.
