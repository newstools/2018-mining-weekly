JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Coal developer MC Mining has appointed CFO Brenda Berlin as an executive director to its board and also announced two nonexecutive director appointments. Berlin was named CFO in November last year and joined MC from Impala Platinum, where she held a number of senior appointments, including head of group corporate finance activities. An Chee Sin and Brian He Zhen, meanwhile, will join MC as nonexecutive directors.
