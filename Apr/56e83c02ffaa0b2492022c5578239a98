JOHANNESBURG – Thieves broke into Harmony Gold Mining’s Kalgold mine Tuesday morning and stole 12 kg (386 oz) of the precious metal, according to spokesperson Lauren Fourie. The robbers accessed “heavily guarded” gold storage facilities in a significant security breach at the mine, situated in South Africa’s North West province, she said. The incident is being investigated. “The gold was stored at the mine under heavy security,” Fourie said by phone. “It was a brazen attack, luckily nobody was hurt.” At current prices the stolen gold is worth about $519 000.
