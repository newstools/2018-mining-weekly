JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Coal and energy company Maatla Energy’s subsidiary, Maatla Resources, has received approval for the environmental-impact assessment (EIA) for its Mmamabula export coal mine, in Botswana. Maatla Resources has also submitted a mining licence application to the Botswana authorities. The Mmamabula coal mine is located in one of the main coalfields in Botswana and contains more than 90-million tonnes of high-grade thermal coal. The mine has a life in excess of 25 years and is targeting initial production of 50 000 t/m, ramping up to 100 000 t/m within the first year of production. Maatla Resources is on track to start site establishment and construction activities this year, with first coal sales expected in 2019. There is an upward movement in the international coal price and an increasing demand for high-grade sized coal in the Southern Africa inland market. The Mmamabula coal mine will produce high-grade coal for cement and lime producers, paper mills, chemical industries, brickworks, breweries, sugar estates, hospitals and for general boiler applications in Southern Africa. “We are excited about the EIA approval and the recent submission of the mining licence application. “The company is making great progress to reach production by mid-2019. There is currently a large deficit for high grade sized coal in the region and we are hoping to capitalise on this opportunity in the very near future,” commented Maatla Energy CEO Jacques Badenhorst.
