JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed Metal Tiger on Monday announced that it and joint venture (JV) partner MOD Resources have applied to the Botswana Department of Environmental Affairs for approval for an environmental management plan (EMP) for drilling within the about 697 km2 T20 Dome complex. The EMP for the T20 Dome, in the Kalahari copperbelt, will allow for the drilling of new and existing targets identified along a 140-km-long strike of the Central Structural Corridor. An additional 939 km2 airborne electromagnetic (EM) geophysics survey is planned to begin in the middle of this year, in order to link up the previous three EM trial survey blocks over the centre of the T20 Dome. “The submission of the EMP for the T20 Dome will, where awarded, provide access to important strategic ground for the JV and open up an additional 697 km2 of underexplored and prospective Kalahari copperbelt for drilling,” Metal Tiger CEO Michael McNeilly said in a statement. He added that the opening of the T20 Dome for drilling will allow for the possibility of adding to a pipeline of confirmed copper targets, while the companies move the T3 resource through the mine feasibility study process. “With the recently awarded T3 Dome EMP, drilling is planned to begin at the T3 Dome in May, and we look forward to the prospect of exciting drill intersections.” Meanwhile, the T20 Dome EMP has been lodged for permission to test several new and existing targets along the Central Structural Corridor along the northern part of the T20 Dome complex. The approval of the T20 Dome EMP will increase the total area available to drill to about 1 377 km2, which will comprise the T3 and T20 domes.
