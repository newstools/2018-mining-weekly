JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – East Africa-focused Shanta Gold has reported positive reverse circulation (RC) drilling results at its Singida project, in Tanzania. Encouraging mineralised drilling intersections achieved include 10 m at 20.82 g/t of gold from 138 m, including 3 m at 57.13 g/t. “These positive drilling results have the potential to enhance the current project economics at Singida, as well as improve the prospects of expanding the project beyond the current scope of construction,” CEO Eric Zurrin said in a statement on Monday. The RC drilling programme was aimed at testing the down-dip and down-plunge continuity of the high-grade mineralised shoots that will facilitate upgrading of resources immediately below the current designed pits from the inferred to the measured and indicated categories. The first part of the drilling programme focused on the Gold Tree and Jem deposits in February and March, during which 15 holes totalling 1 603 m were completed.
