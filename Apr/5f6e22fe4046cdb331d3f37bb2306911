JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner De Beers’ global sightholder and auction sales earned the company $520-million in the third sales cycle of this year. This is lower than the $563-million earned in the second sales cycle of this year, as well as the $586-million earned in the third sales cycle of 2017. De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver said that while the second quarter of the year is traditionally a seasonally slower period, the company continued to see good rough diamond demand in the third sales cycle of this year, as diamond businesses have focused on restocking following healthy consumer demand for diamond jewellery in the US and China.
