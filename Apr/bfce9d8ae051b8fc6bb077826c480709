JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – The joint development agreement (JDA) for Aim-listed Ncondezi Energy’s integrated 300 MW power plant and coal mine project in Tete, Mozambique, remains on track for completion by the end of July. Proposals for the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and operations and maintenance (O&M) contracts have been received but require additional information, which is expected to be provided by April 23. An internal review of the preliminary EPC and O&M proposals is currently under way, and is expected to be completed by the end of May. In addition, in-principle support was received from Electricity de Mozambique (EDM) and the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy for Ncondezi’s proposed strategic partners. Ncondezi is also hoping to secure in-principle support for a new tariff envelope from EDM by the end of June.
