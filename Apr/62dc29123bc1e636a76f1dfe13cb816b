JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) â€“ The joint committees overseeing the development of the Tulu Kapi gold project, in western Ethiopia, have formalised resettlement arrangements for the affected households in the area. The committees comprise representatives from Aim-listed Kefi Minerals, as well as from the Ethiopian government and authorities. Kefi will now execute its preparations for community resettlement, which follows the appointment of new government leadership at several levels since the appointment of the Ethiopian PM Abiye Ahmed in March. The Tulu Kapi gold project is progressing towards development, following a grant of a mining licence in April 2015. The reserve is estimated to have 15.4-million tonnes at 2.1 g/t of gold.  Kefi has refined contractual terms for project construction and operations. The openpit mine will produce an estimated 140 000 oz/y of gold over a seven-year life.
