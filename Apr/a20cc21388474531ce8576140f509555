JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – West Africa-focused gold exploration company Cora Gold has completed the first reconnaissance drill programme at its Tekeledougou gold project in southern Mali. Seven reconnaissance reverse circulation drill holes for 2 007 m were completed at Tekeledougou and two prospects, Kouroudian and Woyani, were drilled to vertical depths of 110 m and 125 m. Both prospects are highlighted by large surface area artisanal workings, in some cases extending over more than 600 m of strike, with broad quartz shear structures. Surface and drilling data indicates potential widths of the steeply dipping sheeted quartz vein structures to be in excess of 30 m to 40 m, suggesting a structure likely to be amenable to bulk mining. “As at our Sanankoro gold discovery 60 km away, visible gold was seen in samples panned at the drill rig at Tekeledougou.  We see significant potential to extend these wide structures well beyond the already identified footprint which, if consistently mineralised, could lead to a large gold deposit,” CEO Jonathan Foster said in a statement on Monday. Initial assay results from Tekeledougou are expected in the second quarter of the year.
