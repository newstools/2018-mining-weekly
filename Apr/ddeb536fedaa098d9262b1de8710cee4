JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed Erris Resources has been awarded two exploration licences in southern Sweden, which the company says contain a number of historic and high-grade gold occurrences of up to 68 g/t. Erris CEO Merlin Marr-Johnson said on Monday that the company’s field teams were preparing to soon start the first phase of the reconnaissance programme of mapping and sampling. “The Nordgruvan project is in line with our stated objective to identify low-cost opportunities that have the potential to create shareholder value. The geological setting is prospective, the historic grades are exciting, and the licences were available on application to the government,” he added. The licences – Nordgruvan No 1 and Hornkullen No 2 – fall outside the existing joint venture with Canadian miner Centerra Gold. The 32.3 km2 Nordgruvan and the 31.9 km2 Hornkullen licences are situated north and south of Filipstad town, Värmlands, respectively. Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) reports indicate the host geology of the area to include early granitoid intrusions. The SGU rock and boulder dataset includes reported grades of 68 g/t, 27 g/t, and 15 g/t gold at Nordgruvan. Hornkullen is located 6 km south of Nordgruvan and hosts a number of historic lead/silver/gold workings with reported gold grades of up to 4 g/t gold in outcrop.
