JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Africa-focused exploration project generator Altus Strategies has received conditional approval from the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) to list the company’s ordinary shares on the exchange. Final approval for the listing is conditional upon Altus satisfying certain customary listing conditions and requirements, including providing certain documentation and information to the TSX-V. The net proceeds from the TSX-V listing will be used for exploration and generative activities on the company’s licences in Africa and for general corporate purposes. Altus currently has 17 projects in six commodities across six countries and aims to position its shareholders at the vanguard of value creation, with significantly reduced risks that are traditionally associated with investments in the mineral exploration sector. Altus’ ordinary shares remain listed on the Aim market of the LSE.
