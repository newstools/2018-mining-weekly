VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) â€“ Montreal-based miner Semafo reported on Thursday that construction of the Burkina Faso-based Boungou mine, in Burkina Faso, is 91% complete, and 10% of the equipment has already been commissioned. Commissioning exercises started in February, focusing first on the crushing circuit equipment and water services. The reclaim and grinding circuits, reagent and oxygen plants are also undergoing testing. Wet commissioning started at the end of March with the corporation pumping water from the water storage facility to the raw water tanks for the processing plant. The company said it is still on track to pour the first gold early in the third quarter. Development continues to track on budget, with $194-million of the $231-million capital expenditure incurred. Semafo advised that it has started recruiting mine operator employees and training started in April, and is expected to be completed by May. Pre-stripping is 77% complete, with 14-million of the projected 18-million tonnes extracted. The first ore will be hauled and placed on the run-of-mine pad at month-end.
