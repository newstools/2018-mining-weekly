The group on Wednesday posted an increase in earnings before noncash operating expenses and interest to a positive R27.2-million during the six months under review, compared with the loss of R4.06-million in the corresponding period of the prior year. “The Jubilee team has demonstrated their commitment to excellence by delivering the Hernic project in time and on budget and ramping up the project to already achieve a unit cost per platinum group metal (PGM) ounce produced of only $382,” Jubilee CEO Leon Coetzer said on Wednesday. Jubilee’s gross profit for the period under review increased to R41.85-million, from R16.20-million in the corresponding six-month period in 2016.

During the period, revenue increased to R105.8-million, from R86.8-million in the prior comparable period. The Hernic operation produced 6 629 oz during the six months, with the unit cost per PGM ounce produced at a record low of $382 in the second quarter. “The Hernic project continued to deliver significant operational improvements quarter-on-quarter following the commissioning and first production in March 2017,” he said.
