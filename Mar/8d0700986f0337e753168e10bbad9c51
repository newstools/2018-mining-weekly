JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed gold producer Goldplat’s Gold Recovery Ghana (GRG) subsidiary has completed the installation and commissioning of an elution plant and all associated ancillary equipment at its gold recovery site in Tema, Ghana. When GRG’s Ghanaian licence to buy and deal gold was renewed in December 2016, one of the requirements was that an elution plant be installed and brought into production by June 30, this year. “Having the infrastructure to elute and smelt on site in Ghana not only fulfils the requirements set out in the licence renewal, but it makes economic sense for GRG, Goldplat and the local community,” stated the company. Goldplat added that, as with further beneficiation to gold doré bars being carried out in-country, additional employment opportunities are created, while cost savings are achieved for GRG. The addition of the elution infrastructure adds to the ability to expand Goldplats’ recovery operations using GRG as a hub. Goldplat CEO Gerard Kisbey-Green said this capital project, which was completed three months ahead of the June 30 deadline, was within budget.
