JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Irish exploration company Connemara Mining has restarted drilling at the Mine River gold project in Wicklow/Wexford, with a 1 000 m programme over 10 drill holes. The company has prioritised two targets that lie along a target trend identified through airborne geophysics, soil and rock geochemical surveys, and historic drilling. At the one target, Tombreen, the company recently reported drilling results of 16.1 g/t gold in Hole 17-TB-01 over 2 m from 78 m depth. The other target lies 2.5 km to the south-west at Knocknalour. "We are pleased to report drilling has re-commenced at our Mine River gold project. We had very encouraging results at the Tombreen prospect and are looking to build on that,” said Connemara CEO Patrick Cullen. The Mine River block currently comprises 11 contiguous prospecting licences with a total area of about 475 km2. The area was the focus of the Wicklow gold rush of 1795 and gold mining continued on a small-scale until the mid-1800s.
