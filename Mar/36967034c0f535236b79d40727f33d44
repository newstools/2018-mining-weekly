JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) â€“ Diversified black-led mining company African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) on Friday announced a 15% increase in headline earnings for the six months to December 31, to R1 945 million. This increase was mainly as a result of improved headline earnings from the manganese division, ARM Coal, Modikwa platinum mine and ARM Copper. The company, headed by executive chairperson Patrice Motsepe, has declared an interim dividend of 250c a share for the six month, totalling R549-million. Basic earnings were R1 753-million, compared with a first half loss of R254-million on impairment of R711-million at Nkomati nickel mine and R734-million at Modikwa platinum mines. Higher dollar prices were realised for all commodities in ARM's portfolio except iron-ore, platinum and chrome concentrate. Disposal of ARM and Vale's 80% interest in Lubambe copper mine in Zambia has been completed, ARM's interest in Two Rivers platinum mine has increased to 54%. Cash dividends received from the Assmang joint venture were R1 000-million and since the period end, ARM received a cash dividend of R2 000-million from Assmang.
