PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal developer Prairie Mining and Polish coal miner Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa (JSW) have struck a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) over the potential cooperation over the Australian firm’s Polish coal projects. The NDA will allow the two companies to exchange technical and commercial information for a period of up to six months, in order to facilitate more substantial discussions over any potential transaction over Prairie’s Debiensko-1 and Jan Karski projects. JSW will assess the feasibility and economics of the two projects. The Polish company owns the Knurów-Szczygłowice mine, which borders on the Debiensko-1 project and will investigate opportunities for using existing infrastructure for the mine development. The NDA was signed after Prairie approached JSW in February regarding potential cooperation at its Polish projects.
