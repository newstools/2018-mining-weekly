PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium developer Kidman Resources has reported a 54% increase in the resource estimate at its Earl Grey project, in Western Australia. Following a 12-month resource definition and exploration programme, Kidman has increased the resource estimate at Earl Grey to 189-million tonnes, grading 1.5% lithium oxide (Li2O) for 7.03-million tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent. Some 91% of the resource is measured as classified or indicated. Kidman MD and CEO Martin Donohue said on Monday that the resource increase firmly positioned the Earl Grey project as a tier one, globally significant hard rock lithium deposit. “Importantly, the expanded exploration target within Kidman’s highly strategic Forrestania landholding, where multiple pegmatite targets maintain to be tested, provides continued upside.” The project has an exploration target of between 20-million and 40-million tonnes, grading between 1.3% and 1.5% Li2O.
