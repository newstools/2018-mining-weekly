JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe has called for increased vigilance on health and safety in the mining sector, after three fatalities were reported this week. Two employees died in a seismic-related fall-of-ground incident at Harmony Gold’s Joel mine, near Welkom, in the Free State, on Tuesday. The third fatality occurred at diversified miner Sibanye-Stillwater’s Khuseleka operation, in Rustenburg, North West, earlier in the week. The three fatalities bring to 22 the number of fatalities recorded in the first quarter of this year. The National Union of Mineworkers on Monday said five of the 22 fatalities have occurred at Sibanye-Stillwater’s operations. The union also called for more serious intervention regarding the health and safety of mineworkers. “Turning the tide on fatalities in the sector is the responsibility of all social partners – government, labour and business – and is critical for the sustainability of the mining industry in the long term,” the Department of Mineral Resources stated on Wednesday.
