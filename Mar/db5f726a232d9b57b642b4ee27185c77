LONDON â€“ Russian billionaires Vladimir Potanin and Roman Abramovich and aluminium producer Rusal have agreed to allow the sale by Abramovich of a 4% stake in mining giant Norilsk Nickel on a pro rata basis to Potanin and Rusal, a lawyer for Rusal said on Thursday. The three sides of the dispute reached the deal with undertakings that it can be unwound if found to be in violation of a shareholder agreement at trial, Rusal's lawyer told a London court on Thursday.
