JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) - Global engineering firm DRA has secured a contract with Exxaro Coal Mpumalanga, a subsidiary of JSE-listed Exxaro Resources, to build a 500 t/h coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP), in Belfast, Mpumalanga.
	
	The CHPP will comprise primary and secondary sizing stations, an overland conveyor, two 7 500 t silos, low-gravity and high-gravity dense-medium separation (DMS) modules, a thickener circuit, a filter plant and a stacker conveyor. The plant will produce both a domestic and an export product.
