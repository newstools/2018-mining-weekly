RIO DE JANEIRO â€“ Anglo American on Friday clinched two long-awaited environmental licenses that pave the way for the global mining company to expand its Minas-Rio iron-ore mine in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Minas Gerais environmental regulator Semad granted a pre-installation and installation permit to the miner for the project, which would boost output capacity by about 56%, once the miner receives an additional operating permit.
