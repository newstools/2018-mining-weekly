JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Aim-listed tin miner AfriTin Mining has acquired the entire front-end crushing component for the processing circuit of the Phase 1 processing plant at the company’s Uis tin mine, in Namibia. The equipment includes a jaw crusher, three cone crushers, stacking and conveying equipment and an electrical switchgear. AfriTin has also appointed Namibia-based engineering firm Crushplant and Utility Spares to match the equipment to the required specifications and associated installation at the mine site.
