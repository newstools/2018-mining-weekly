SANTIAGO â€“ The main union for Chilean mine Caserones has accepted a revised contractual offer from the copper company, which averted the threat of a strike, according to an internal memo sent to workers early on Friday. An agreement between the union and the mining company, controlled by JX Holding and Mitsui Mining, had been on the brink of failure over last-minute discrepancies, which led to further negotiations until midnight on Thursday. "We have reached an agreement on the drafting of the collective contract, and we have signed the collective agreement, thus ending the negotiation process," the board said in an internal union statement. If a deal had not been reached, workers had planned to begin a strike at the mine in northern Chile on Friday morning. Caserones mined 122 800 t of copper last year, just over 2% of Chile's annual copper production.
