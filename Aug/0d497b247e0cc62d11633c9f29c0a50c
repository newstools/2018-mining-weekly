TSX-V-listed Namibia Critical Metals has identified multiple prospective targets at its Kunene cobalt/copper project, in Namibia, following the completion of an airborne electromagnetic survey covering 4 200 line kilometers. The survey data shows clear conductive trends associated with favourable sedimentary horizons and structures known to be associated with cobalt/copper mineralisation. Of particular interest are the prolific number of responses along a 20-km-long segment of the interpreted extension of the dolomite ore formation (DOF) and along a 15-km-long segment of the Okanihova lineament. The DOF hosts the Opuwo cobalt/copper/zinc deposit of Celsius Resources, and historic drilling by First Quantum Minerals intersected anomalous copper and cobalt along the Okanihova lineament. Two more isolated targets were identified at Okanihova East and Olulilwa Southwest. The survey results enable the company to pinpoint drill targets on the ground. “We will undertake a systematic reconnaissance drilling approach, use one diamond drill (for 2 km) and one reverse circulation drill rig (also for 2 km) to test multiple targets, before the end of September,” said Namibia Critical Metals president Don Burton.
