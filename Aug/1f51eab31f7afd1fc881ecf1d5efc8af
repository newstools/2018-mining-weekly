TSX-listed lithium-focused junior Critical Elements has appointed Dr Marcus Brune as finance VP. Brune will join the senior management team and will oversee the structuring of the compnay’s wholly-owned Rose lithium/tantalum project debt financing, strategic investment and offtake agreements. “We are pleased to welcome Dr Brune to the management team, where he will oversee all financial activities, including evaluating and securing sources of funding, forecasting and budget management. “His extensive financial and technical experience, particularly as CFO of Rockwood Lithium, will be valuable to Critical Elements as the company continues its transition towards becoming a lithium producer,” the company stated. Critical Elements added that the Rose project remains on track to be permitted by the end of the first half of 2019. A private placement that closed in May continues to provide sufficient capital to fund the permitting process.
