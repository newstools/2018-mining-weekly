The crushing circuit at BlueRock Diamonds’ Kareevlei mine, in the Northern Cape, is now processing at its targeted production level of around 80 t/h following the installation of a second cone crusher and the implementation of optimisation initiatives. In June, BlueRock discovered a fault in the circuit’s cone crusher, which led to processing being stopped for around ten days. While the fault was being rectified, a rented crusher was installed on site at modest additional cost. The original cone crusher is now refurbished and operating in tandem with the rented crushing unit, increasing the throughput capacity in the secondary crushing process. The 80 t/h processing capability will contribute to producing stockpiled material to alleviate the production challenges usually present in the rainy period from January to April.
