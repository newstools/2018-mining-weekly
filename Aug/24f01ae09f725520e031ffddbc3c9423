Coal miner Yancoal Ltd said on Tuesday that it will restart its Austar coking coal mine in New South Wales state after receiving regulatory approval to resume production. Work at the mine was halted in early July following a safety dispute with the New South Wales Resources Regulator. Employees from the mine who were redeployed to other operations during a stand-down period will be recalled, the company said in a statement. Austar employs 205 people. Yancoal applied for a dual listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) last month. The company is a unit of China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Co Ltd.
