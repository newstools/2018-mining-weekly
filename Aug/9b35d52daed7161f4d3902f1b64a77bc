Aim-listed Keras Resources has made a number of appointments to advance the 10 000 t bulk sampling metallurgical testwork programme at the Nayega manganese project, in northern Togo. Keras has appointed Graham Stacey as project manager, Carriere Mines Travaux Public (CMTP) as the turnkey mining and logistics contractor and Appropriate Process Technologies to undertake the bulk sampling plant contract. “The bulk sampling exercise is progressing well and the appointments are critical to the success of the operation,” CEO Russell Lamming said in a statement on Wednesday. Stacey and CMTP have been working closely on the programme scheduling and have mobilised equipment to commence operations on August 27. Although this is a single bulk sample exercise, Keras has opted to buy the bespoke scrubber plant rather than outsource to ensure that the optimal grade is achieved during this programme and that it can seamlessly transition to commercial production once approval is granted. The scrubber plant has a ten-week lead time, resulting in an estimated completion date for the entire bulk sampling programme of mid-January 2019.
