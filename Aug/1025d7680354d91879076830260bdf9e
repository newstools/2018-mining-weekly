PERTH (miningweekly.com) – First lithium concentrate from ASX-listed Altura Mining’s lithium mine has been hauled to Port Hedland, ahead of first shipments. “MD James Brown said on Wednesday that the start of haulage was another important step for the company. “We will continue to focus on working towards this first shipment and subsequent shipments for the remainder of 2018. We remain fully focused on the ramp-up, so we can get the project operating at its optimum level as soon as possible. The trucking comes after Altura in July reported first production from its flagship project, which at full capacity will produce 220 000 t/y of 6% lithium concentrate. Spodumene concentrate from the mine will be stockpiled in a purpose-built storage facility in Port Hedland, which has a capacity of 40 000 t, with Altura presently having the rights to 30 000 t. At full production, logistics provider Qube Logistics will haul some 18 000 t/m to Port Hedland, using a combined fleet of single and double road trains.
