PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Doray Minerals told shareholders on Thursday that the temporary interruption to underground mining activities at its Deflector operation, in Western Australia, was not expected to affect the production guidance at the mine. While underground operations have been temporarily suspended following a fire involving a remotely controlled underground loader, the processing plant at Deflector continued to process stockpiled ore, the miner said. MD Leigh Junk said mining was expected to resume shortly, pending confirmation that no further hazards existed. “Our first priority is the safety of our people. We won’t resume mining until the workplace has been confirmed safe. This said, we expect mining operations to recommence without significant delay.”
