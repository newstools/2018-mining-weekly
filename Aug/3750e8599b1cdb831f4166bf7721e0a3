Diamcor Mining has recovered six special rough diamonds at its Krone-Endora at Venetia project, in South Africa’s Limpopo province. The diamonds were recovered from material processed through the company's newly upgraded facilities. The diamonds recovered include a high-quality 18.45 ct gem octahedron rough diamond, two gem-quality rough diamonds weighing 18.56 ct and 14.71 ct respectively, and three nongem-quality rough diamonds weighing 21.92 ct, 17.32 ct and 15.84 ct. The recoveries are the result of limited processing completed during July and the first week of August. “We are very pleased with the results of the initial modifications made to the processing plants, as well as with the number of larger diamonds recovered on very limited volumes,” Diamcor CEO Dean Taylor said on Friday.
