Canadian lithium and uranium exploration company Plateau Energy Metals, which is advancing projects in the Macusani Plateau in south-eastern Peru, has a new CEO. The company announced on Monday that its board had appointed Alex Holmes, who most recently was a partner and cofounder of Oxygen Capital. Holmes is also a cofounder of True Gold and played an instrumental role as part of the senior leadership team in advancing that company’s Karma mine, in Burkina Faso, from initial asset acquisition in 2013, to gold production in early 2016. Over that period, Holmes and his team raised more than $215-million to construct and operate the Karma mine. “I am excited to be joining Plateau, which has advanced the new Falchani lithium project from discovery to initial resource, while continuing to progress the preliminary economic assessment stage Macusani uranium project,” stated Holmes. He said that Plateau was in a unique position of possessing substantial resources of both lithium and uranium, within the same property package, providing a strong foundation for growth. Executive chairperson Ian Stalker had served as interim CEO.
