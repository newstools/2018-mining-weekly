PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Gold Mountain has completed the assembly and commissioning of a large-capacity mobile plant to process coarse gold and platinum bulk samples. Gold Mountain holds a number of exploration tenements in Papua New Guinea, with its flagship Crown Ridge project in the final stage assessment of potentially high cash-flow-free gold and platinum in conglomerate. The junior company said that the start of the processing of infill and extension pit samples will be a significant development, as it will remove a significant bottleneck in the definition of the mineral resource estimate. The plant is also expected to improve bulk sample processing speeds and will aid with reconciliation and validation of the expected mineral resource estimate. The plant also has a circuit specifically designed to maximise the recovery of black sands, that will allow for meaningful analysis for titanium, vanadium and chrome concentrates. “This is a pivotal time for Gold Mountain, with a great boost to the near-surface mineral resource estimate process at Crown Ridge, concurrent with diamond drilling of the Mongai Creek porphyry copper/gold system,” said MD Tony Teng.
