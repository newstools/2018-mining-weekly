Canada-based precious metals miner Tahoe Resources on Wednesday reported a theft attempt at the La Arena mine, stating that it appeared that there was an attempt to illegally extract gold from a pipeline at the Peru operation. An internal investigation shows that holes were cut into the top of the pipeline to place bags of carbon inside in an attempt to absorb gold from the solution. One of the bags of carbon blocked the pipeline and resulted in a discharge of the solution into a collection pond from which clean water is discharged into the Sayapampa Creek. The miner stated that it was in the process of addressing the contamination of the storm water management system and that it did not expect a material impact on production. The company has reported the incident to the Agency for Environmental Assessment and Control, the Ministry of Energy and Mines, the police and the public prosecutor. The surrounding communities have also been notified.
