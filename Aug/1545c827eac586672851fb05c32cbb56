TOKYO â€“ Japanese utilities and global mining giant Glencore have settled an Australian thermal coal import contract for April 2018 to March 2019 at $110/t, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. The deals were struck between Glencore and Japanese utilities such as Shikoku Electric, Chugoku Electric and Kansai Electric after bilateral talks, a source at a Japanese coal buyer said, requesting anonymity as he was not allowed to speak in public about commercial deals. Glencore didn't respond to a request for comment. A Chugoku Electric spokesman confirmed it has struck some annual contracts at $110/t with Glencore, but said some other deals were agreed at different prices or index-linked prices. Shikoku Electric said it settled the April-March contract with Glencore last month but declined to disclose the price. Kansai Electric was not immediately available for comment. "We've agreed with Glencore at $110/t for the April-March contract late last month," another source at a utility directly involved in the talks said, also declining to be named. A trader with a major commodity merchant also confirmed the deals.
