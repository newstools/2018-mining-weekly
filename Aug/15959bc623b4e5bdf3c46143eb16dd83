TORONTO â€“ Canadian diversified miner Teck Resources said on Tuesday that lead smelting had resumed at its Trail, British Columbia, facility after a seven-day suspension because of wildfires in the province. Teck shut down lead smelting on August 19 because the flash smelting technology requires high-purity oxygen, which an on-site plant could not supply because of poor air quality. Zinc operations at the complex were unaffected. Trail operations have returned to normal, said spokesman Chris Stannell. "Regional air quality conditions continue to be actively monitored," he added. In June, Vancouver-based Teck forecast Trail production at 65 000 t of refined lead for 2018. There are more than 500 wildfires burning in British Columbia, which declared a state of emergency on August 15. Weekend rain and cooler temperatures have helped fire-fighting efforts.
