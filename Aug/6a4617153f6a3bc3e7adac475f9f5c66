In this role, I will continue to work with my fellow directors to seek to advance the company in the interests of all of its stakeholders over the long term,” English commented. Acacia’s board now comprises an interim chairperson, one executive director, three independent nonexecutive directors and one Barrick nominee nonexecutive director.
