Aim-listed IronRidge Resources has defined at least five large, coherent gold targets at its Dorothe project, in Chat. Drill results received defined targets over 500 m to 1.2 km strike length and 100 m to 200 m widths from trenching; with targets still open along strike. Geologists have received results from 6 608 m of 9 360 m of trenching completed, with 8 984 m having been sent to the laboratory for assay during the last field season. Results have defined high-priority gold targets with trenching results including 4m at 18.77 g/t gold, 32 m at 2.02 g/t gold and 12 m at 2.53 g/t gold. IronRidge reported that two dominant types of mineralisation had been identified; a steeply east dipping main vein target and shallow west dipping sheeted vein targets. "Results of the infill and extensional trenches received to date have defined multiple, high-priority gold targets at the Dorothe prospect. The results are highly encouraging, not only due to the widths and grades intersected in 'fresh rock', but also because they demonstrate continuity and scale of the target zones," chief geologist Len Kolff said in a statement on Thursday. IronRidge said it had purchased a containerised sample preparation lab to establish in N'Djamena, which would facilitate sample preparation and improve sample turnaround time. The sample preparation lab would be able to process rock and soil samples from the field programmes, ready for air freight dispatch to the assay laboratory in a more efficient manner.
