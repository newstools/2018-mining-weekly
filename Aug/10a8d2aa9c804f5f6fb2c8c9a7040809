PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Graphmada large flake graphite mine, in Madagascar, has reached nameplate capacity, ASX-listed Bass Metals reported on Wednesday. The company told shareholders that the process plant has reached a sustained 25 t/h feed rate at an average head grade of 4.5% total graphitic carbon, an effective run rate of 500 t/m process plant production. The concentrates produced are at materially higher saleable grades than historic production, Bass said, with the majority of production at or above 94% fixed carbon. “We are very pleased to reach this significant milestone for the company,” said Bass nonexecutive chairperson Rick Anthon. “Our focus has always been to establish positive cash flows and achieving the desired run-rate gives us a clear path to this goal.” Positive cash flow from operations is expected in 2018, Anthon said.
