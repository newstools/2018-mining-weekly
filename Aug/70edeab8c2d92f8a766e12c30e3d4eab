The recently upgraded processing plant at the Omagh gold mine has started operating, using feed from the underground development of the Kearney gold vein, Toronto- and London-listed Galantas Gold reported on Wednesday. The processing plant is expected to operate part time until production stoping starts late in 2018 or early in 2019. Galantas said that the plant operated a froth flotation system for production of a gold/silver concentrate. This process removes the sulphide minerals and gold and concentrates them into a product suitable for smelter treatment. The concentrate is then exported, via Belfast port, to a smelter. The process operates without the use of cyanide reagents.
