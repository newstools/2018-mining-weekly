Metals explorer Cameo Cobalt has started its Phase 1 work programme at the Big Mac gold project, which the TSX-V-listed junior acquired earlier this week. The 2018 programme will consist of an airborne magnetic survey, with a total of 500 line kilometers planned for the 9 263.88 ha. Phase 1 aims to identify magnetic targets within the Big Mac property that will be followed up on with ground-based work during a Phase 2 programme. The Big Mac gold project shares more than 30 km of contiguous claim boundaries on the east and west sides of Aben Resource's Forrest Kerr gold project, where drill hole FK18-10 returned four separate high-grade zones, with the best zone delivering an interval of 38.7 g/t of gold over 10 m, including 62.4 g/t of gold over 6.0 m, starting at 114 m downhole. Cameo has engaged Ridgeline Exploration Services, from Kelowna, for the Phase 1 programme. Meanwhile, Cameo announced the appointment of Golden Ridge Resources VP for exploration, Chris Paul, to its board of directors. The company noted that Paul, also cofounder of Ridgeline Exploration Services, was fundamental in Golden Ridgeâ€™s recent drill discovery of the Williams copper/gold porphyry, which intersected 327 m of 0.31% copper, 0.35 g/t gold and 1.94 g/t silver.
