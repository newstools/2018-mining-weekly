PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed Infinity Lithium Corporation has launched a lithium hydroxide scoping study at its San Jose resource, in Spain. The lithium hydroxide scoping study will start in direct response to the increased demand and supply chain considerations in the evolving battery chemicals market, the junior company said on Friday. The San Jose project is expected to produce lithium carbonate through the use of contemporary sulphate roast-water leach technology, with Infinity telling shareholders that the current lithium carbonate feasibility study will continue in parallel with the lithium hydroxide scoping study, due to the large amount of process, design and mining overlap. The scoping study would assist in determining the progression of the San Jose feasibility study to either a lithium carbonate or hydroxide battery chemical product. A recently completed technical option study estimated that an additional $61-million investment will be required to construct the lithium hydroxide plant, and assuming the same ore feed from the pit as the 15 000 t/y lithium carbonate plant is used, the lithium hydroxide plant would create some 16 000 t/y of battery grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate. Infinity told shareholders on Friday that the new study demonstrated the company could adapt to evolving market conditions, and the growing demand for lithium hydroxide in response to requirements from strategic partners.
