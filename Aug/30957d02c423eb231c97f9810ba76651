ASX-listed Bass Metals has achieved another milestone in the development of the Graphmada mine in Madagascar, with the company announcing on Monday that it had achieved its first sales revenue from the sale of concentrates from the large flake graphite mine. Bass, which earlier this month achieved nameplate capacity at Graphmada, said that it was close to reaching its final Stage 1 objective of achieving positive cash flow from operations. The company sold 100 t of concentrates through an established offtake agreement into Europe. For jumbo flake concentrates, a price of $1Â 700/t free-on-board was achieved. Bass said it had a further 300 t of saleable concentrates warehoused.
