Construction of Vancouver-based Eastern Platinum’s (Eastplats’) retreatment project, at its Crocodile River mine, in South Africa’s North West, is progressing well and all significant items required for the chrome circuit’s completion and commissioning are on site. Completion of the form structures continues. In March, Eastplats and its subsidiary Barplats Mines entered into a framework agreement with Union Goal relating to the construction, mining and processing of the tailings resource and offtake of chrome concentrate from Barplats’ tailings facility at the Crocodile River mine. Eastplats reported on Wednesday that the tailings facility is progressing well and that dam construction continues on schedule. Construction is currently estimated to be completed before the end of the third quarter, immediately followed by commissioning. Eastplats expects the retreatment project will result in revenue-producing operations through offtake of the chrome concentrates to Union Goal during the fourth quarter. The company stated that the retreatment project is a primary focus and that other projects have been placed on hold, since all resources have been allocated for the project’s completion.
