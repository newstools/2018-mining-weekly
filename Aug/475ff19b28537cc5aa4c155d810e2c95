PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Australian oil and gas major Santos on Wednesday reported that drilling at its Barikewa-3 well, in Papua New Guinea (PNG), has confirmed that there was significant natural gas resource close to the PNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) project infrastructure, which could still be developed. The well intersected 25 m of net gas pay within the Toro and Hedinia reservoir objectives, with the reservoir quality exceeding pre-drill expectations, Santos said. The well reached a total depth of 1 943 m in July, and will be plugged and abandoned on completion of the test and data retrieval. Santos MD and CEO Kevin Gallagher said the Barikewa-3 results were encouraging. “Barikewa is located approximately 10 km from the PNG LNG gas pipeline and is therefore well placed to play a part in the future LNG expansion project.”
