PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) on Friday said that a plethora of positions were still available in the state’s resources sector. The state government this week revealed that some 4 400 new jobs were created in July across Queensland, the 22nd straight month of jobs growth. Employment Minister Shannon Fentiman said that the government’s focus on core industries was resulting in jobs being generated across the state. “We’re lucky to have a really diverse economy here in Queensland and we are seeing jobs being created across a number of industries,” Fentiman said. The QRC on Friday said that the sector was continuing to contribute one new job every hour across the state and more than 1 400 vacancies currently advertised online. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said the resources sector supported one in every eight jobs in Queensland. “The resources sector is creating more jobs, delivering more exports and generating more royalties for Queensland. The world wants what we have, particularly with the expansion of renewables, electric vehicles and infrastructure,” Macfarlane said. “Over the last 12 months, the resources sector has created more than 8 400 jobs, the equivalent of one job an hour. We can continue to create opportunities through direct jobs and spin-off benefits for regional communities right across the state. “A strong resources sector means a strong Queensland. We are determined to work with the government for even more jobs, exports and royalties. We need predictable laws to ensure we can invest even more to explore and sustainably develop Queensland’s resources for the benefit of all Queenslanders,” Macfarlane said.
