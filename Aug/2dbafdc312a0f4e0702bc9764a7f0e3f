PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed junior TopTung on Friday said that it would now seek shareholder approval to acquire an advanced unlisted base metals explorer Zeus Minerals, following a positive due diligence period. TopTung earlier this month announced its intention to acquire Zeus for a non-refundable deposit of A$50 000, and A$1.25-million in shares. Zeus is an advanced nickel/copper sulphide explorer that has three highly prospective projects located in Quebec, which contain a number of drill proven occurrences. With the due diligence now complete, TopTung will look to obtain shareholder approval for the transaction at the company’s annual general meeting, in October.
