PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Diamond miner Lucapa has recovered more special and coloured diamonds from its Mothae diamond mine, in Lesotho. The special recoveries included a 28 ct stone from the North zone and two light pink diamonds. Lucapa noted that the latest recovery was in addition to the other specials recently recovered, including an 89 ct yellow from the South-East zone, a 25 ct yellow from the Neck zone, and a 12 ct white from the North zone. The recovery of the two pink diamonds also followed the recovery of a 3 ct pink diamond in the historic bulk sampling conducted between 2008 and 2012, proving that Mothae also hosts pink diamonds. The current ongoing bulk sampling programme is designed to expand the published one-million-carat Joint Ore Reserves Committee resource by testing areas of the kimberlite pipe that are not included in the resource, or which require further sampling to enhance the resource.
