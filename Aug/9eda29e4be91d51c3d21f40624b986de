Potash developer Kore Potash has received environmental- and social-impact assessment (Esia) approval for its Dougou mining licence in the Republic of Congo (RoC). Approval of the assessment is a prerequisite to start construction of a mining project in the RoC. The Esia authorises the development of the potential mining project at the Dougou carnallite deposit and could be extended in future to include the Dougou extension sylvinite deposit. Permitting for the development of the Dougou deposits creates potential to use potash from these deposits to increase the production rate (or extend project life) at the nearby Kola project, which is currently undergoing a definitive feasibility study (DFS). The company’s key strategic ambition is to bring the flagship Kola project into production, but it is important to keep the potential scale of the potash basin in mind, Kore CEO Brad Sampson said on Tuesday. The Dougou mining licence is adjacent to the company’s flagship Kola mining licence and to the company’s Sintoukola 2 exploration licence. Together, the two mining licences and the exploration licence comprise the Sintoukola potash project, which covers 955 km2 of this emerging potash basin.
