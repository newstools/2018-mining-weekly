Aim-listed Armadale Capital has completed a diamond drilling programme at its Mahenge Liandu graphite project, in Tanzania, with eight holes for a total of 489 m drilled, ahead of an anticipated decision to mine in early 2019. All holes intersected mineralisation from surface over wide thicknesses averaging 55 m and up to 67 m. The resource project-focussed company on Wednesday said “excellent core recovery was achieved” and pointed out that the mineralisation correlates well to the results of the reverse circulation (RC) drilling programme conducted in 2017. The cores will be used to produce representative graphite concentrates to advance the product marketing, as well as to refine the process flowsheet, the company explained. Armadale director Nick Johansen further said all aspects of the development work at the Mahenge Liandu project were progressing encouragingly. “These latest diamond drill results, which highlighted high-grade mineralisation in every hole, over wide intervals from surface with up to 67 m thickness, are particularly pleasing and further reinforce our understanding of the geology of the Mahenge Liandu project,” he elaborated. Johansen also pointed out that the area drilled covers Armadale’s proposed initial mining area and the results of the drilling will be incorporated into its mine planning over the coming months. “Drilling continues on site; however, the bulk of our activities are now focussed on the completion of the environmental-impact assessment, relocation plan and valuation survey – all critical components of our development plan as we target first production within 12 to 18 months.” The completion of the RC programme and delivery of the company’s relocation plan and ancillary surveys are expected in the coming weeks.
