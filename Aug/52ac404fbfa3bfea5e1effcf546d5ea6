A court hearing has been scheduled for August 10 to consider a provisional liquidation application against Kareevlei Mining, a subsidiary of Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds. The application was brought by former BlueRock CEO Riaan Visser. BlueRock believes the application is without merit. Kareevlei Mining holds the mining right over the Kareevlei diamond mine, in South Africaâ€™s Northern Cape.
