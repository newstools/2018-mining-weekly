Gold exploration and development company Conroy Gold has conditionally raised £500 000 through a placing of shares to fund the advancement of its gold assets in Ireland. The placing at 13.75p a share is a premium of 20% to the closing mid-market price on August 24, Conroy said on Tuesday. The funds would be used for the development of the Clontibret deposit, together with exploration focused on the Clay Lake, Glenish and Slieve Glah gold prospects within the 65 km Armagh-Monaghan-Cavan gold belt.
