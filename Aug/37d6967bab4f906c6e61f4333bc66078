Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo will speak at the 2019 Investing in African Mining Indaba, which will be held at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from February 4 to 7. Ghana is considered one of the major mining centres on the African continent; therefore, with Akufo-Addo speaking, it presents delegates with the opportunity to hear about the future of mining in Ghana. The President intends to ensure the Ghanaian government’s commitment towards expanding local and international value chains, which will especially benefit small producers and entrepreneurs from Ghana. Next year will be the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Indaba, growing from a small conference to one of the most highly anticipated events in the industry, and will build on 2018’s success. The event is expected to feature a host of initiatives to celebrate 25 years of progress in African mining, such as a themed afterparty, historical timeline wall of past Indabas and a publically nominated ‘Top 25 at 25’ competition to showcase the 25 most influential people in mining over the last 25 years. This builds well on 2018’s event, which registered a 15% increase in overall attendance and 47% more mining executives, and saw new elements such as the junior mining showcase being well-received by delegates.
