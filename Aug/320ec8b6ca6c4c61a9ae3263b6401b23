The Armenia Environmental and Mining Inspection Body has directed Canada-listed Lydian International to stop mining-related activities at its Amulsar mine, after red-listed plants and animal species were identified at the project for the first time. The Ministry of Nature Protection has to conduct a study of ecological factors regarding the directive issued by the head of the inspection body, Artur Grigoryan, who alleges that acantholimon caryophyllaceum boiss plant species and parnassius apollo animal species have been identified on the site. The directive was issued after a recently completed inspection as part of the country’s compliance audits of the mining sector. Lydian, however, said that it disagreed with the finding of new plants and animal species, based on the company’s previously accepted environmental impact assessment. The firm said it would take all necessary action to reverse the assertion, including appealing the issuance of the directive. Following the audit, the Environmental and Mining Inspection Body made several recommendations, including that temporary mobile crushers that were not contemplated in the original construction programme be decommissioned. The company stated that it would work with the government to address the matters and that it would be able to appeal any recommendations within a two-month period. Lydian has recently faced upheaval at the Amulsar project, where illegal road blockages have prevented access to the site. Amulsar will be a large-scale operation with production targeted to average about 225 000 oz/y over an initial ten-year mine life.
