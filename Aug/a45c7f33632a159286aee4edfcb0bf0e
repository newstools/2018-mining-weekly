TSX-listed West Africa-focused gold exploration and production company Semafo on Friday reported that a bus transporting employees from the town of Bobo-Dioulasso to the Mana mine, in Burkina Faso, had been shot at by armed bandits on Friday morning. One Semafo national employee and one subcontractor lost their lives in the exchange of fire between police officers and the bandits. “Early analysis suggests that this incident and the armed incident that occurred in the Est region six days ago are unrelated. However, the corporation will be increasing its security measures at Mana and take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the mine and of its employees.” Semafo on Monday reported that five gendarmes and one subcontractor employee had lost their lives in an armed incident that occurred between the town of Fada and the Boungou mine site, in the Est region of Burkina Faso.
