The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) has served a Section 54 notice on ASX-listed Jupiter Mines’ Tshipi Borwa manganese mine, in South Africa’s Kalahari manganese field, to temporarily suspend operations. The notice was reportedly issued owing to a recent pit wall failure and drilling and blasting patterns. Processing, logistics and shipping operations continue. Jupiter on Monday said that, fortunately, Tshipi is comfortably ahead of its business plan for the financial year to July, having shipped 1.6-million tonnes, compared with the targeted 1.3-million tonnes. However, should the notice not be lifted this week, October’s sales will be affected. The Tshipi management team is working to resolve the issues and will meet with the DMR this week to progress the matter.
