MOSCOW â€“ The Russian government thinks it would be impractical to raise more taxes from metals and mining companies that are earning windfall profits, the Russian finance ministry said on Friday. President Vladimir Putin called last week for further discussion of a proposal by Kremlin aide Andrei Belousov to increase taxes for metals and mining firms. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Belousov will meet the business community on Aug. 24 to discuss ways to distribute additional profit generated from a weaker rouble, a spokesman for the ministry said.
