KALGOORLIE â€“ Privately held Dundas Mining is restarting its Avebury nickel mine in Tasmania early next year and Swiss trading house Transamine has secured the offtake, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Avebury, which had most recently been owned by China-backed MMG, was sold to Dundas last year and has been on care and maintenance since 2009. The mine will produce around 7 000 t to 8 000 t of nickel and Transamine has secured offtake for the full amount, the person said. The concentrate will be sold into the battery and stainless steel markets. The trading house will provide a line of finance in double digit millions of dollars, the person said.
