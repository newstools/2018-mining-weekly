Canadian gold producer Yamana Gold has promoted Daniel Racine to president and CEO, from his current role as executive VP COO, while current chairperson and CEO, Peter Marrone, is assuming a newly created role as executive chairperson. Marrone, who is the founder of Yamana, will be accountable to the board of directors and will serve as a liaison between the board and management. He will also serve as a guide and mentor to Racine and to management of the company more generally. Yamana, which announced the changes last week, stated that the creation of an executive chairperson role was consistent with the companyâ€™s ongoing review of management effectiveness and succession planning. Racine has been with the company since 2014.
