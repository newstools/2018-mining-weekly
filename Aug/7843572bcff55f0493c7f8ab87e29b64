PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Junior gold developer Azumah Resources would need to establish a reserve base of at least one-million ounces at its Wa gold project, in Ghana, before a positive project decision could be made, MD Stephen Stone said on Wednesday. The company is working to add to the current 624 000 oz reserve before it will make a project decision, which is targeted in 12 months' time. Stone said that Azumah was targeting a growth in the reserve through greenfield and brownfield exploration at Wa. The company is looking at improving the existing pits through capturing the resource previously left out of project studies, as well as deepening the pits and investigating the possibility of underground operations. Azumah is expected to deliver a resource and reserve update in November, to be followed by a feasibility study and updated resource and reserve estimate in the third quarter of 2019, ahead of a decision to proceed.
