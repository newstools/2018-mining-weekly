PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Senex Energy has been given commonwealth environmental approval for its Western Surat gas project, bringing the project one step closer to development. Along with the previously granted state environmental approvals and petroleum lease, Senex has received all primary approvals to start development of the Western Surat gas project, initially focusing on the Glenora and Eos blocks. The company told shareholders on Tuesday that it was continuing to progress the remaining financial, commercial and contracting requirements, prior to taking a financial investment decision. “We are delighted to have achieved this critical milestone for the Western Surat gas project. This approval follows the recent announcement of a cost effective corporate and development debt facility, as well as partnering with Jemena for delivery of Project Atlas infrastructure,” said Senex MD and CEO Ian Davies. “This progress demonstrates continuing strong momentum in the execution of our gas projects and our east coast gas strategy.” Under the Project Atlas agreement, Jemena will build, own and operate a gas processing facility with an initial capacity of 40 TJ/d and a 60-km pipeline to process and transport gas from Project Atlas via the Darling Downs pipeline to the Wallumbilla hub. Jamena will fund the A$140-million capital required to construct and commission the facility, with Senex to deliver raw gas into the downstream infrastructure and Jemena to deliver sales specification gas into the Wallumbilla gas hub, at multiple delivery points. The Western Surat gas project, in turn, has a targeted production of up to 50 TJ/d, with the gas to be supplied to the Gladstone liquefied natural gas project under a binding 20-year sales agreement.
