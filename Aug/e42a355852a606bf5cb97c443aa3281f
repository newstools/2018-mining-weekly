The Browns Range pilot plant, in Western Australia, has achieved mechanical completion, with the process plant components having been installed, powered up and tested as part of the commissioning process, heavy rare earths developer Northern Minerals reported on Monday. The beneficiation plant, having been load commissioned in June, is performing well with about 100 t of xenotime concentrate produced through the beneficiation plant to date. “Mechanical completion is an important milestone for the company and having 100 t of xenotime concentrate stockpiled provides a great base as we move into commissioning the back end of the hydromet plant. “Given we have only been commissioning the pilot plant for a short period of time, early results from the beneficiation plant are very encouraging,” MD and CEO George Bauk commented on Monday. The pilot plant is expected to produce 573 000 kg of mixed heavy rare earth carbonate containing terbium and dysprosium as revenue products, over a three-year period. Browns Range is the first producer of heavy rare earths outside of China.
