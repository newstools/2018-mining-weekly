TSX-listed Champion Iron on Tuesday announced the appointment of Natacha Garoute as CFO. Garoute has more than 20 years of finance experience, with a strong focus on mining, most recently as CFO of TSX-listed gold producer Roxgold. Besides being responsible for Roxgold’s financial affairs, including supervision of corporate functions, financial reporting, treasury, legal and corporate governance, Garoute actively participated in strategic planning and completed C$115-million in public offerings and private placement financings, despite significant political risks and a weak gold environment, and successfully negotiated a $75-million project financing facility under a complex legal environment. Previous to her tenure at Roxgold, Garoute was corporate controller at gold miner Semafo and also held positions at Canadian National Railway, MDD Forensic Accountants and PwC. “We are excited to welcome Natacha Garoute to the Champion team,” stated Champion Iron executive chairperson and CEO Michael O’Keeffe. “Natacha’s comprehensive understanding of the mining industry and her extensive finance experience further strengthens Champion as it moves towards the next stage of its development, as an iron-ore producer intent on sustaining a long-life, low-cost operation at its recently restarted Bloom Lake iron-ore mine.” Garoute replaces Miles Nagamatsu, who has served as Champion’s CFO since 2014, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Champion Iron Mines since 2006.
