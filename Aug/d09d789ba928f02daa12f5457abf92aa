PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Graphite developer Walkabout Resources will look to advance project funding negotiations after a mining licence was granted for its Lindi Jumbo project, in Tanzania. “The mining licence approval is the final major legislative requirement for the project,” said Walkabout MD Allan Mulligan on Thursday. “We have been assured by the Ministry of Minerals of Tanzania of their support and willingness to assist the emerging mining industry in Tanzania, meeting those regulatory obligations required to facilitate mine development and grow the industry. “This has been a difficult year for mining in Tanzania, and where there are some issues still to work through, the legislative uncertainty is now resolved,” Mulligan told delegates at the African Downunder conference, in Perth. Walkabout’s $29.6-million Lindi Jumbo project is expected to produce some 40 000 t/y of graphite-in-concentrate over a mine life of 20 years. Mulligan noted that detailed engineering for the project was now nearing completion, while the project’s engineering, procurement and construction partners in China expected to start equipment manufacturing within the next week. “We have enough in the treasury to start the project, and with the mining licence now in place, we can start discussions with funding partners.” “Securing the mining licence means Walkabout can now fast-track Lindi Jumbo and we anticipate first shipments of large flake graphite concentrate within 9 to 12 month,” he added.
