Following two armed incidents at TSX-listed gold mining company Semafoâ€™s Mana and Boungou mines, in Burkina Faso, which claimed the lives of eight people in the last two weeks, the company is now transporting all expatriate employees to the mine sites by helicopter. In addition, a ground military force has been deployed on the route between the Boungou mine and the capital city, Ouagadougou. These measures, combined with a heightened escort presence, will ensure the safe transportation of national employees to and from the mine to their villages, Semafo said on Monday. Additionally, the company has noted that there are reinforced escorts for transportation of national employees to and from its Mana mine. Senior management, including the CEO, are in the country to ensure that all necessary measures are being taken to ensure the safety of all Semafo personnel. The Mana and Boungou mines continue to operate without interruption.
