PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Australian Bauxite has told shareholders that its ALCORE subsidiary would have the global licence rights for bauxite refining using the ALCORE technology. The global licence will allow ALCORE to build multiple plants in any location to meet the growing demand for aluminium fluoride (AIF3) and associated co-products as increased aluminium smelter production and the use of AIF3 in lithium-ion batteries increases demand for AIF3. “Step by step Australian Bauxite is bringing ALCORE’s powerful new bauxite refining technology closer to becoming an important domestic producer and supplier of key AIF3 products for the Australasian aluminium smelters,” said Australian Bauxite CEO Ian Levy. “However, in the longer-term, these global technology rights allow ALCORE to produce AIF3 in any location globally. Creating ALCORE as a project-specific subsidiary is expected to unlock considerable value for shareholders in both the short and the medium terms,” he added. Construction has started at the ALCORE Stage 1 project, in New South Wales, with the pilot plant expected to produce AIF3 samples. The Stage 1 operation budget is set at A$2.5-million at the approved site, and will start with the production of AIF3 test samples, and then the production of Corethane, which is pure hydrocarbon powder refined from low-value coals. Stage 2 operation will consist of a 50 000 t/y production plant, which will cost about A$50-million to develop. Levy said on Wednesday that the ALCORE technology also produces several valuable co-products including silica fume for the cement industry and Corethane pure hydrocarbons for energy and fuel security. “Upside potential includes production of pure AIF3 for lithium-ion batteries, ion-oxide pigments, and titanium oxide pigments. Further potential exists for developing ultra-pure products such as high purity alumina for the manufacture of scratch-resistant sapphire glass for phones and computer screens,” Levy added.
