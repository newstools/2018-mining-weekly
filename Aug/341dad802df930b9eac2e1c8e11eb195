Aim-listed Kibo Energy has received provisional approval from the Lake Rukwa Water Basin Board for water permits for the Mbeya coal-to-power project (MCPP), in Tanzania. An application was made to permit the operation of numerous water boreholes, which the Africa-focussed energy company said are integral to the Mbeya coal mine's dewatering plan. The provisional approval of these water permits is also an integral part of the water supply strategy for the Mbeya power station. Permanent water permits will be issued following completion of the construction and implementation of all necessary water infrastructure that will be required to meet the water needs of the Mbeya power plant and coal mine. Additionally, Kibo has also completed the process of additional submissions related to the local content plan and integrity plan. The Mining Commission is now in receipt of a special mining licence application for the Mbeya coal mine. Kibo is further involved in a “myriad of activities related to the finalisation of the MCPP power purchase agreement, as well as subsequent funding and financial close processes,” CEO Louis Coetzee said in a statement on Thursday.
