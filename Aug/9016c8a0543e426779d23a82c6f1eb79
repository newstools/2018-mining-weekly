As ASX- and TSX-V-listed West African Resources moves into the development phase at its 90%-owned Sanbrado gold project, in Burkina Faso, the gold developer has also announced a key management appointment and project update. Matthew Wilcox will join the West African executive team as chief development officer in September, and will directly manage the construction of Sanbrado. Prior to his appointment at West African, Wilcox was project director for the construction of Nordgold’s four-million-tonne-a-year Bissa gold project and eight-million-tonne-a-year Bouly gold project, both in Burkina Faso. He was also the GM of Nordgold’s six-million-tonne-a-year Lefa gold project, in Guinea, and most recently, the project director for the construction of the 12-million-tonne-a-year Gross gold project, in Russia. “Appointing a chief development officer [of Wilcox’s] calibre is a key milestone for the company as we progress our Sanbrado gold project to production. [His] hands-on experience, including managing the construction of two large gold mines in Burkina Faso, will translate well for a successful build for West African,” MD Richard Hyde commented on Monday.

He further added that both of the most recent projects Wilcox led through to completion were successfully delivered on time, and on or below budget. “We look forward to Matthew joining the company in early September.”
