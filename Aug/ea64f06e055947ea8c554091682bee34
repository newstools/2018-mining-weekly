PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Thunderbird mineral sands project, in Western Australia, has been granted environmental approval from the state’s Environment Minister Stephen Dawson. Project owner Sheffield Resources said on Monday that following the completion of the state environmental approvals process, the final step is to obtain federal approval from the Commonwealth government, with the process already under way and expected to be concluded in the September quarter. “Minister Dawson’s announcement of state environmental approval for Thunderbird takes us a step closer to the commencement of construction of the 42-year project,” said Sheffield MD Bruce McFadzean. “Our Kimberley-based team are vigorously progressing on-site government-approved preliminary works, which are well under way. At the same time, we remain equally focused on finalising the remaining permits.” Over its 42-year mine life, Thunderbird is expected to deliver 76 100 t/y of premium zircon, 68 500 t/y of zircon concentrate, 387 800 t/y of ilmenite and 229 800 t/y of titano-magnetite. Thunderbird will be developed in two stages, with Stage 1 estimated to cost A$271-million to deliver an initial 8.5-million-tonne-a-year operation, doubling to 17-million tonnes a year in the fifth year of operation, for an additional cost of A$195-million.
