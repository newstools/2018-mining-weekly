The Gahcho Kué diamond mine that Canadian miner Mountain Province owns in partnership with Anglo America’s De Beers has recovered 1.93-million carats at an average grade of 2.15 c/t in the second quarter of the year, setting a new quarterly record and delivering a 20% year-on-year production improvement. The mine, located in the Canadian tundra, achieved commercial production last year. The Gahcho Kué plant treated 899 000 t during the June quarter, 17% ahead of the same quarter last year. In the first half of 2018, the plant treated 1.68-million tonnes. Ore tonnes mined in the second quarter decreased to 341 000 t, from 940 000 t in the same period last year, mainly owing to a high waste cycle in the quarter as a result of the start up of the Hearne pit. TSX-listed Mountain Province affirmed its full-year guidance of 6.3-million to 6.6-milion carats recovered. "The second quarter performance continues to follow the trend of ongoing excellent performance set by the GK Mine team, in a safe and sustainable manner.  We expect this trend to continue as we enter the second half of the year.  The continued good performance is pleasing as the mine matures into its steady state production methodology of continuous improvement,” said Mountain Province president and CEO Stuart Brown. that TSX-listed Mountain Province owns in a partnership with Anglo America’s De Beers,
