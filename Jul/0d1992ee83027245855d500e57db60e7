Experienced lithium consulting engineers Primero Group have been appointed as the lead engineering group for the Mina do Barosso feasibility study, Aim-listed Savannah Resources announced on Tuesday. The study will build on the outcomes of the June 2018 scoping study, which confirmed that the Portugal project has the potential to be a major European producer of spodumene. Savannah said it planned to develop a mine and concentrator model based around Mina do Barrosoâ€™s deposits for the production of lithium concentrate, with additional ceramic coproducts. The company added that Primero would bring knowledge and understanding of specific ceramic-related coproducts, such as feldspar and quartz. Savannah is working towards an objective of being the first major producer of lithium in Western Europe by 2022.
