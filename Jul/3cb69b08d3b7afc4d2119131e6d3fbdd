Gowans, a past president of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, currently serves on the boards of Arizona and Cameco, as well as Gedex Technologies, an innovative geophysics systems company. "We are very pleased to welcome Jim to the board," stated New Gold chairperson Ian Pearce on Tuesday. "He is highly qualified, with a strong background in operational execution. Jim brings a unique combination of strategic leadership and operational accomplishment and a demonstrated capacity for innovation and change management.” The addition of Gowans brings the total board to seven members, six of whom are independent.
