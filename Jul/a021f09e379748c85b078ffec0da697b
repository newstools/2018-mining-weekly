Earnings a share are likely to be between 778c and 866c, compared with the loss a share of 453c in the prior comparable period. The company attributed the expected increase in headline earnings and basic earnings to an improved operational performance, as well as an improvement in the rand basket price for the period. In addition, in the comparable period, Amplats had attributable post tax-impairments totalling R2.2-billion, which impacted on basic earnings and headline earnings. Basic earnings in the current period are impacted on by an impairment of R600-million relating to the disposal of the 33% holding in the Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine joint venture to Royal Bafokeng Platinum and a loss of R800-million on the finalisation of the disposal of Union Mine and Masa Chrome, while benefiting from an insurance receipt of R200-million in respect of property damage suffered at the convertor plant in 2017. Both basic and headline earnings benefit from a revaluation gain on the deferred consideration in respect of the sale of the Rustenburg Mines of R300-million.
