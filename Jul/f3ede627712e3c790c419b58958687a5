Aim-listed Shanta Gold has drilled four new high-grade intersections as part of the Phase 1 drilling campaign at its Tanzania-based Bauhinia Creek East underground mine. The new high-grade intersections are situated at depth and to the east of the historical exploration drill hole CSD063, which included an intersection of 6 m, averaging 43.98 g/t gold. The new intersections are all outside the existing mineral reserves and demonstrate the potential for continued high-grade resource growth. “These drilling results provide further evidence of high-grade extension at New Luika's Bauhinia Creek deposit. The mineralisation is easily accessible from our existing underground operations and will require minimal capital investment. “Proving the high-grade extensions has been a priority for Shanta as we continue to focus on adding to our current mine life," CEO Eric Zurrin said in a statement on Wednesday. The drilling results are over a strike length of 80 m with holes spaced at 40 m sections.
