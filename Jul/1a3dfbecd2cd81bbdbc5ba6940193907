Uranium project developer Berkeley Energia has ticked all the boxes for the listing of its issued ordinary shares on the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges and is now the only listed mining firm in Spain. Admission to the Spanish exchanges will be effective from Wednesday, through the Spanish automated quotation system. The company, which is investing €250-million in the Salamanca uranium mine, last month listed on the main market of the London stock exchange and also trades on the Australian exchange. "It is a great honour to join the ranks of the famous listed Spanish companies and to become the only listed mining company in the birthplace of Rio Tinto,” said MD and CEO Paul Atherley. Berkeley sees its listing as the first step toward long-term investment in the mining sector in Spain, and hopes to restore an old tradition of industrial mining in the country. British Ambassador to Spain and Andorra Simon Manley commented in a media statement that the potential investment was an example of the strength of British investment in Spain, pointing to the  €60-billion bilateral trading relationship between the countries. The company has not raised any funds or issued any new shares in connection with LSE and Spanish stock exchange admissions.
