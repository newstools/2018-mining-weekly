PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining services provider NRW Holdings has been awarded a A$176-million contract by mining major BHP for bulk earthworks and concrete works at the South Flank project, in the Pilbara. The South Flank operation will leverage and expand on the existing Mining Area C hub, and is BHP's preferred option to replace the 80-million-tonne-a-year Yandi mine, which will reach the end of its mine life in early- to mid-2020. First ore from the South Flank operation is being targeted for 2021, and the project ramp-up will coincide with the ramp-down of the Yandi operation.

Works to be undertaken by NRW include bulk earthworks and concrete for the overland conveyors and primary crushers together with ancillary works relating to non-process infrastructure. Bulk earthworks also include access tracks, clearing, pads and diversion drains. Concrete works and associated detailed earthworks include placement of approximately 14 000 m³ of concrete. The contract is expected to run for 15 months commencing on site in September 2018. At peak over 350 workers will be required on site. Plant and equipment required will comprise internally sourced fleet together with a range of hired equipment.
