PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Browns Range heavy rare earths pilot processing plant was officially opened on Friday. Owner Northern Minerals told shareholders that the project was now officially the first producer of heavy rare earths outside of China. “The opening of the Browns Range heavy rare earths project is nearly eight years in the making, since the initial discovery in 2010,” said MD and CEO George Bauk. “There are not too many times when an MD can stand up and launch a new industry in Australia and this is what we are doing today.” The pilot plant is expected to produce 573 000 kg of mixed heavy rare earth carbonate containing terbium and dysprosium as revenue products, over a three-year period. The first heavy rare earth carbonate production from Browns Range is slated for the September quarter. "The Browns Range pilot processing plant is a major milestone for this industry and will be a major job-creator for the Kimberley region and Western Australia,” Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan said on Friday. “It's great to see Western Australia going further than just digging up minerals, and moving into the value-add chain.”
