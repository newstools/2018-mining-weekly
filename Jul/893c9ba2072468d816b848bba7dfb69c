NEW DELHI â€“ India's Oil Ministry is in favour of a ban on the import of petroleum coke, the government's lawyer told the Supreme Court on Monday. An oil refinery by-product, petroleum coke, or petcoke, is used as a fuel because of its higher energy content than coal, but it releases larger amounts of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide, which can cause lung disease and acid rain.
