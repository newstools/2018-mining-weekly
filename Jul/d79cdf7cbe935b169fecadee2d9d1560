JSE-listed Harmony Gold’s Hidden Valley operation, in Papua New Guinea reached commercial levels of production in June. “The investment in the Stage 5 and 6 cutback was delivered safely, on schedule and below budget and we are confident that Hidden Valley will produce more than 180 000 oz in the 2019 financial year,” CEO Peter Steenkamp said in a statement on Thursday. Meanwhile, engagement with the Papua New Guinea government on the application for a special mining lease for the Wafi-Golpu project is also progressing well. in June, the Wafi-Golpu Joint Venture submitted an environmental-impact statement (EIS) for the Wafi-Golpu project to the relevant Papua New Guinean regulatory authority, the Conservation and Environment Protection Agency. The EIS has been prepared as the statutory basis for the environmental, social and cultural heritage assessment of the Wafi-Golpu project under the Environment Act 2000 and will inform a decision by the Papua New Guinea government as to whether to grant an environment permit and, if so, under what conditions.
