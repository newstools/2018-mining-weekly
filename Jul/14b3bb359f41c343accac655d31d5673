PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Western Australian gold producer Blackham Resources has reported record production for the six months to June, with 40 024 oz delivered. This was a 31% increase on the 30 541 oz delivered in the previous half-year, the miner said on Wednesday. “The June half’s operational results demonstrate significantly stronger production and a step change in the operation’s economics that commenced in December 2017,” said Blackham executive chairperson Milan Jerkovic. “Record production and significantly reduced costs underpinned stronger operational cash flows for the half.” The half-year production increase was driven by improved mill feed grade, which improved to 1.47 g/t gold due to processing more high-grade ore, and the debottlenecking of the processing plant Gold production in the June quarter reached 19 393 oz, which was in line with the 20 631 oz produced in the previous quarter, with record throughput of 535 000 t reported in the three months to June. Looking ahead, Blackham is expecting to produce between 77 000 oz and 89 000 oz of gold in the 2019 financial year, with all-in sustaining costs forecast at between A$1 250/oz and A$1 450/oz
