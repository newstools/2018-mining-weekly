Just over 264-million shares of potash company Danakali have been admitted to trading on the LSE. Executive chairperson Seamus Cornelius on Tuesday said that the company was “delighted to deliver on another of its strategic goals for 2018”, adding that the LSE listing should increase its profile, liquidity and breadth of potential investors. “It is a key milestone as we move towards construction and production at the Colluli potash project,” he commented. The company, which is also listed on the ASX, is developing the low-cost greenfield Colluli project, in Eritrea, which is expected to produce 944 000 t/y of sulphate of potash at full production.
