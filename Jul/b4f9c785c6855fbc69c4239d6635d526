PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) has welcomed a decision by US major Peabody to extend its North Goonyella metallurgical coal mine, near Moranbah. Peabody on Thursday reported that with some 71-million short tonnes across the mine, the North Goonyella South project would extend the mine’s life until at least 2026, and reflected the continued strong demand for Australian metallurgical coal exports to serve the growing demand centers in Asia. Peabody president for Australia, George Schuller, said to support the mine’s extension, the company is investigating a new longwall system featuring a 300 m face conveyor and advanced longwall technology, including automated steering and a reduced maintenance requirement. “Not only does that improve safety for our operators, it enables faster haulage speeds for our high-quality reserves,” Schuller said. The mine extension is expected to require an additional 230 staff. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said the announcement was more good news for the state’s coal industry and the men and women it supports through full-time jobs. “Extending the mine’s life until 2026 will see an exciting new project come on line – North Goonyella South - and secure the jobs of more than 230 employees many of whom live locally,” Macfarlane said. “It again demonstrates the strong demand for Queensland coal especially metallurgical coal which is used to make steel.” Macfarlane pointed to Peabody’s long-standing relationships with Indian steelmakers, with India expected to overtake China as the world’s largest importer of metallurgical coal by 2020. “The Indian steel story will continue to grow along with its urbanisation story. The Queensland resources sector can help meet the needs of growing economies, and create jobs and investment here in Australia.”
