Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto has been granted chain of custody certification by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI). Rio Tinto is the first mining and metals company to be granted this certification, which means the company will be the only one selling aluminium that customers can be assured has been produced to the highest environmental, social and governance standards. Rio Tinto is also a founding member of the ASI. The certification reinforces Rio Tinto's commitment to responsible mining and metals production by providing independent verification that material can be traced through a chain of custody spanning Rio Tinto's Gove bauxite mine, in Australia, to its alumina refinery, aluminium smelters and casthouses in Quebec, Canada. Rio Tinto aluminium VP and ASI board member Tolga Egrilmezer says the company sees certified sustainable aluminium as a point of differentiation for Rio Tinto as customers become increasingly interested in ensuring that metals have been responsibly produced.
