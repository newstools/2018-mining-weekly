PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Widgiemooltha gold project, in Western Australia, has poured its first gold, owner Mincor Resources reported. The first parcel of ore comprised material sourced from the start-up upper benches of the Flinders and Bass pits, with Mincor telling shareholders that mining remained on track to deliver 40 000 t of ore per month, as scheduled. The full toll parcel for the month of August is already stockpiled and ready for delivery. Mincor MD Peter Muccilli said that the first gold pour at Widgiemooltha underscored the hard work by the company’s employees to progress a set of regional gold assets that had little value assigned to them a few years ago, into an active mining operation which will deliver cash flows in the months ahead. “The gold cash-flows will help to accelerate the company’s active ongoing nickel exploration programmes, which are aimed at fast-tracking the development of Mincor’s high-quality Kambalda nickel portfolio to take advantage of the forecast growth in the nickel market over the next few years.” Widgiemooltha is expected to produce 71 700 oz of gold over a 29-month mine life.
