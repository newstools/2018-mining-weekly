Holdings in global gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) decreased by 49.3 t to 2 434 t in June, the World Gold Council (WGC) reports. It notes that outflows were dominated by North American funds, losing $1.9-billion as a result of dollar strength and a lower gold price. Funds listed in Asia and other regions lost $149-million and $89-million respectively. European funds, however, saw marginal inflows in June, with gold holdings having increased by 0.5 t or $52-million. The WGC further reports that, on a year-to-date basis, European funds have added 52.5 t or $2.5-billion.
