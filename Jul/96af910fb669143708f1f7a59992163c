JOHANNESBURG â€“ A mineral sands operation on the South African coast run by Rio Tinto has been closed since Friday due to violent community protests which saw a security guard killed earlier this week, the company and a union said on Wednesday. "Due to the escalation in activity around the blockades on the access roads, staff were sent home on Friday. Our highest priority is the safety of our people," a Rio spokesperson said. The operation, Richards Bay Minerals, is on South Africa's Indian Ocean coast.
