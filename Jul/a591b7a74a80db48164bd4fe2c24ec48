Semi-massive and injected-stringer sulphide veins have been intersected at Orion Minerals’ Rok Optel nickel/copper prospect, in the Areachap Belt, in the Northern Cape. The company noted in a release on Monday that the intersections achieved provide strong geological proof of concept for Orion’s expectation that the Jacomynspan group of intrusions has good potential to host high-grade massive sulphide mineralisation similar to the Nova-Bollinger deposit, in the Fraser Range, in Western Australia. "We have now demonstrated that geological conditions exist for accumulation of large intrusive massive sulphide bodies similar to Nova-Bollinger and that our modern exploration techniques will facilitate discovery of these massive sulphides,” CEO Errol Smart said. Orion Minerals has also continued an intensive drill programme on its deep sulphide target at its Prieska project, in the Northern Cape, during the three months to June 30. By the end of the quarter, 67 158 m of drilling had been completed on the deep sulphide target. Orion had completed 56 mother and deflected holes and received assays from 53 intersections on the deep sulphide target. Intersections in these holes were achieved at vertical depths of 880 m to 1 220 m, requiring the setting of 355 directional wedges to steer the drilling to pre-determined target points. At the end of the quarter, analytical results from three more intersections were awaited, while 18 holes were in progress.
