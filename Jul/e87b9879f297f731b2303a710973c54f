Canada's Lundin Mining said on Thursday that it formally commenced an offer to acquire Nevsun Resources or C$4.75 a share in cash, valuing the base metals miner at around C$1.44billion. Earlier this month, Nevsun had said that rival Lundin's offer of C$4.75 undervalues the company and its assets. Lundin Mining said it intends to mail the offer to Nevsun's security holders. Lundin has been trying to acquire Nevsun's large, high-grade Timok copper project in Serbia, but had no appetite for Nevsun's Eritrean mine, so partnered with tiny mine developer Euro Sun Mining for its last buyout proposal for Nevsun.
