Aim-listed Kefi Minerals has appointed deputy chairperson and senior independent nonexecutive director Mark Wellesley-Wood as nonexecutive chairperson, effective immediately. Executive chairperson Harry Anagnostarras-Adams will assume the role of MD, with immediate effect. This move separates the roles of chairperson and MD that Anagnostarras-Adams has fulfilled since late 2014 and reflects the boardâ€™s desire to strengthen its corporate governance as the company transitions to the mine build and operational phases of its development. Kefi is developing the Tulu Kapi gold project, in Ethiopia.
