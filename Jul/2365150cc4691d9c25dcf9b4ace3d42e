The exploration programme at gold producer Nordgold’s Taparko mine, in Burkina Faso, is advancing rapidly and is on track to achieve its objectives of replacing mined gold and increasing resources. In 2017, exploration activity added more than 200 000 oz to Taparko’s mineral resources and some 100 000 oz were added to the ore reserves. This year, Taparko’s specialist team plans to drill more than 40 km to replace and increase reserves and resources. The aggressive exploration programme at the mine is aimed at adding 200 000 oz of gold to reserves and testing to define underground reserves for exploitation in the medium term. Nordgold will also drill new extension target positions at Goengo-Tangarsi oxide resources – 15 km south of Taparko.
