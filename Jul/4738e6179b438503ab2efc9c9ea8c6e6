Gold production at Randgold Resources’ Kibali mine, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is rising steadily on the back of the optimisation of its automated underground operation, and it is on track to beat its guidance of 730 000 oz for 2018, Randgold CE Mark Bristow said on Wednesday. Speaking at a media visit to the mine, Bristow said that, following the example of the gold miner’s Loulo underground mines, Kibali had successfully transitioned from contract mining to owner mining earlier this month. As at Loulo, the move is expected to deliver significant cost and efficiency benefits, while accelerating the transfer of skills to the mine’s Congolese workforce. “Kibali hosts one of the world’s largest underground gold mines and the aim of owner mining is to give us complete control over the day-to-day operations, with everyone focused on the same goal and compliance with the mining plan,” he said. “We’ve also brought in personnel who were involved in the Loulo transition to support Kibali’s Congolese workforce with the transition,” Bristow added. Randgold also introduced ‘Africa First’ technology at Kibali, notably in the automation of the underground materials handling system. “We continue to look at other technologies which could assist us in the optimal development of this great asset,” Bristow noted. Further, the current commissioning of Azambi, Kibali’s third and last hydropower station, as well as its only remaining significant capital project, is expected to start delivering power into the grid within the next month. Bristow noted that, despite the issues around the DRC’s new mining code, Randgold continues to advance its exploration work on a number of new targets. He cautioned that, in its current form, the code could deter future investment in the DRC’s mining sector.
