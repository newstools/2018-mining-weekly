PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ French firm Eramet has started the compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares in ASX-listed Mineral Deposits (MDL), after achieving a shareholding of more than 90%. The directors of MDL earlier this month unanimously recommended the revised takeover offer from Eramet, after the A$1.75-a-share cash offer was declared unconditional. Eramet said on Tuesday that with the compulsory acquisition of the remaining MDL shares now taking place, the offer period has been extended until August 3, and would not be further extended. The French company urged the remaining MDL shareholders to accept the takeover offer, warning that those shares acquired through the compulsory acquisition will only receive their consideration a number of weeks later than the time at which they would have received the consideration if they had accepted the offer.
