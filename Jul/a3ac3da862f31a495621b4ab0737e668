Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) is set to spend about R90-million on its yearly, large-scale maintenance shutdown on the manganese rail line from August 2 to 8. The railway line, which spans three provinces – the Eastern Cape, the Northern Cape and the Free State – will be undergoing specialised infrastructure maintenance and upgrade projects. During the yearly planned maintenance of any of TFR’s rail line, essential maintenance work that cannot take place during the normal occupational conditions, is performed. This maintenance window presents an opportunity to catch up on the maintenance backlog, including replacing old and obsolete infrastructure and accelerating the major capital expansions in line with the expected volume growth on the manganese line.
