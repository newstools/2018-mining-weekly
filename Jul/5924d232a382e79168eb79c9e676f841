ASX- and Aim-listed Crusader Resources has appointed Ausenco do Brasil Engenharia to assist in completing and reviewing the final documentation required to submit the application for the installation licence for the companyâ€™s Borborema gold project, in Brazil. Ausenco will focus initially on the design of the metallurgical processing plant and the mine layout and design. The installation licence will allow the start of engineering work in accordance with the already approved environmental control plan and is the only major outstanding permit required to start mine construction. Crusader has already received the pre-licence from the Rio Grande do Norte State Governmental Department (Idema) in Brazil, which approved the environmental-impact assessment for Borborema. The company has now submitted to Idema all studies related to kinetics of the rocks in relation to drainage generation and lodged an authorisation request for clearing the vegetation in the area of the project for the pit and infrastructure. Critically, Crusader has significant positive support from Idema and the local government for the project. Crusader currently expects to receive the installation licence in the fourth quarter.
