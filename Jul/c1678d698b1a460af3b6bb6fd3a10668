An independent evaluation of a package of diamonds recovered from TSX-V-listed Tsodilo Resources’ BK16 project, in Botswana, has yielded a valuation of, on average, $197.68/ct. The package comprised two parcels totalling 224 diamonds and a total weight of 34.35 ct. It was evaluated by licensed diamond dealer RD Ferraris of QTS Kristal Dinamika. The average value of the larger diamonds in the package was $360.22/ct, while the average value of the smaller diamonds was $87.86/ct. “Although the first package was small, we are encouraged by the evaluation work which gave such a high value to the diamonds. We knew from the historic diamonds that the diamonds in BK16 were high-quality gemstones and it is exciting to see this continuing in our large diameter drilling sample recoveries,” Tsodilo president and COO Dr Michiel de Wit commented on Thursday.
