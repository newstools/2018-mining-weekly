JSE-listed engineering and construction group Murray & Roberts (M&R) has been awarded new projects to the value of R4-billion, to be delivered over the next two years. These awards include projects to be undertaken by M&R’s oil and gas platform in the metals and minerals market in Australasia, as well as the development of a copper mine, in Mongolia, which will be undertaken in joint venture between the oil and gas and underground mining platforms. M&R said on Thursday that in the context of a constrained oil and gas market over the past four years, emphasis has been placed on complementary growth markets such as Australasia’s metals and minerals and infrastructure sectors. “These project awards demonstrate the oil and gas platform’s ability to secure project opportunities in complementary markets,” the company stated.
