PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Suitor Hancock Prospecting’s offer for iron-ore miner Atlas Iron has been declared unconditional. Atlas on Friday said that shareholders who now accepted the Hancock offer could expect a pay-out within seven days of their acceptance. An independent expert recently found that Hancock’s 4.2c-a-share offer for Atlas was both fair and reasonable, prompting the Atlas board to urge shareholder acceptance of the offer. The offer will close on August 3.
