Aim-listed Hummingbird Resources has announced the second set of drill results from the 2018 exploration campaign at its Yanfolila gold mine, in Mali, which further confirms high-grade gold mineralisation potential. The focus of the drill programme is to convert resources to reserves and extend the life-of-mine. Drilling has been ongoing since July and has now focused on the resource definition at Gonka, with some further follow-up drilling at Komana West. The second batch of results delivered positive results, similar to the first batch announced in September, confirming high-grade potential at Gonka, the company reported on Thursday. The additional drilling at Komana West has been useful to the mining operations, since the newly drilled zones have been found outside the resource model and positive results have been found inside the current pit shell, increasing the amount of mineral ore available. Some of the Gonka intercepts include 15 m at 16.03 g/t gold from 207 m depth, 20 m at 4.63 g/t gold from 118 m depth and 11 m at 4.11 g/t gold from 79 m depth. Some of Komana West’s intercepts include 15 m at 4.25 g/t gold from 8 m depth and 12 m at 1.90 g/t gold from 90 m depth. Hummingbird chief geologist Murray Paterson commented that the company is now on target to achieve its operational objective, which is to increase the mine life at Yanfolila. “In light of these results, the exploration team on site is now working to build a mineable resource that will aim to add more openpit and underground ore, extending the current mine life.” So far, the company’s drilling has remained shallow, focusing on infilling the openpit reserves. “The attention will switch to drilling out the underground resources at Gonka, which is exciting since it is where the highest grades and wider intervals have been drilled previously by Gold Fields,” the company stated.
