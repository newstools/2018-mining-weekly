Base metals firm Heron Resources has started commissioning activities at its Woodlawn zinc/copper project, in New South Wales, the ASX-listed firm announced on Wednesday. Commissioning activities mark the start of the final phase in the construction programme for the Woodlawn project, which has now been under way for 16 months. “While there is still much to do this is an exciting time as various components of the process plant are powered up,” said Heron MD Wayne Taylor. Commissioning will ramp up over the next four to eight weeks, as the company makes its transition to a new base metal producer in early 2019. At steady state, Woodlawn will produce 70 000 t/y of zinc concentrates, 30 000 t/y of copper concentrates and 25 000 t/y of lead concentrates.
