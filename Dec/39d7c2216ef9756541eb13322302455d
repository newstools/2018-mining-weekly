Aim-listed companies Kibo Energy and Edenville Energy on Friday both announced that they had resubmitted their respective tender qualification documents to the Tanzania Electricity Supply Company (Tanesco). Kibo is developing the Mbeya coal-to-power project (MCPP) and Edenville the Rukwa coal-to-power project in Tanzania. Tanesco last month resumed its tender process for certain energy projects in the country after identifying certain procedural amendments that had to be made before the process could proceed. “Given that much of the information within [our qualification] document had already been generated, we just needed to ensure that its collation complied with Tanesco’s revised requirements,” Kibo CEO Louis Coetzee said in a statement. With this now complete and having recently been recommended for grant of a special mining licence from the Mining Commission of Tanzania, the company is “hopeful” that 2019 will see the swift advancement of the MCPP in tandem with its two other utility-scale projects in Botswana and Mozambique, he added. Edenville Energy, meanwhile, advised its shareholders that the resubmission and opening of the documents took place in front of other bidders, with Edenville’s documents officially accepted as complete and complying with Tanesco's requirements. This formal process is the initial stage in the selection of projects to provide power to the Tanzanian electricity grid. Tanesco will assess the applications and select projects to move to the next stage of the tender process. No defined time limits have been provided for the completion of the assessment.
