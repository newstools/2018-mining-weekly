Seven female Anglo American employees made it onto the Women in Mining’s annual 100 Global Inspirational Women in Mining list. The judging panel found that Anglo subsidiary De Beers Consolidated Mines CEO Mpumi Zikalala and Anglo subsidiary Kumba Iron Ore Kolomela mine overseer Dineo Phaladi have especially persevered in the face of adversity, found solutions to challenges and empowered others by being a voice and role model for diversity and inclusion. The Anglo employees were selected among 650 nominations from around the world. The list aims to showcase the range of female talent within the global mining industry and to identify inspirational role models to encourage future generations of women to consider mining as a career choice. The other five Anglo employees who made the 2018 list are UK-based Anglo head of talent Malebogo Mpugwa, Anglo Brazil iron-ore and nickel CFO Ana Sanches, UK-based Anglo safety and sustainable development group head Tracey Kerr, Gold Fields Australia openpit mining head Dr Carmen Letton, and UK-based De Beers diamond revenue analyst Susanna Woodward. Women in Mining MD Nichole McCulloch said although amazing talent has been showcased, the industry cannot remain complacent, since there is a lack of female representation at the leadership level. “The industry must keep advancing its diversity and inclusion initiatives so that we can continue to compete for the best and brightest talent out there.”
