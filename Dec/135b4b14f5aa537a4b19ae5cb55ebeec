PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner BHP has been granted development approval for its Venus underground nickel mine, by the Western Australian state government. Venus, which was discovered six years ago, will be the source of high-grade material that will feed the Leinster nickel operation’s mill and concentrator over the next eight years. The Venus deposit is considered one of the most significant opportunities for Nickel West, a spokesperson said, noting that it contains more than 200 000 t of nickel. The underground mining operation will leverage off existing surface and underground infrastructure already in place at the Leinster operation. BHP will continue to drill the Venus deposit over the coming months and first stoping production is targeted for early 2019. The project will employ about 150 people during development and then increase to 200 when the mine is operational.
