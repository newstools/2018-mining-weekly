Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) on Tuesday said its production guidance would change from January 1, 2019, as Sibanye-Stillwaterâ€™s platinum group metals material would no longer be bought as concentrate, but toll treated, with the refined metal returned to Sibanye. Resultantly, metal in concentrate production for 2019 will be lower than the estimated 2.45-million to 2.5-million ounces expected to be produced this year. Amplats anticipates platinum metal in concentrate output of between 2-million and 2.2-million ounces in the 2019, 2020 and 2021 financial years. Palladium production is expected to be between 1.3-million and 1.4-million ounces in the 2019, 2020 and 2021 financial years, compared with between 1.5-million and 1.6-million ounces this year. Amplats has also updated its cost guidance to about $1 600/oz for 2019, compared with about $1 550/oz in 2018.
