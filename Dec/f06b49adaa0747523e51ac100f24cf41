Gold major Barrick Gold has announced management changes in its North American region ahead of the completion of its merger with Africa-focused Randgold Resources on January 1. CFO Catherine Raw will assume responsibility for the enlarged group’s US operations in the newly created position of COO for North America. Raw is taking over responsibility from Barrick USA president Michael Brown, who will be retiring from the company at the end of December, after 24 years with the group. The mining giant said in a media announcement that Brown was responsible for establishing Barrick’s presence in southern Nevada with the opening of the Barrick Global Shared Services Center in Henderson in 2015. “Michael has worked tirelessly to connect Nevada’s mining industry with government, communities, and organisations across the state, always with an emphasis on building mutually-beneficial, long-term partnerships,” said Barrick executive chairperson John L. Thornton. When the $6.1-billion merger with Randgold is completed on January 1, Graham Shuttleworth – the current CFO of Randgold – will assume the role of CFO at Barrick. Randgold CEO Mark Bristow will be Barrick's new president and CEO. Barrick’s Africa and Middle East region will be headed by Randgold’s Willem Jacobs, while Mark Hill will be COO for Latin America and Australia Pacific.
