Firestone Diamonds has recovered a 46 ct white diamond, from its Liqhobong mine, in Lesotho. The diamond was recovered undamaged and will go on sale at the next tender, which is scheduled to take place at the end of January 2019. In a statement on Friday, the company also reported a stabilisation in pricing for the smaller, lower-value diamonds on offer at a sale concluded on December 7. “The recovery of the white 46 ct stone is good news as we start mining across the pit towards the northern side of the orebody over the coming months. We are also pleased by the fact that the prices of our smaller, lower-value goods have stabilised and we look forward to further improvement as we head into the new year on the back of an expected positive diamond jewellery retail season,” commented Firestone CEO Paul Bosma.
