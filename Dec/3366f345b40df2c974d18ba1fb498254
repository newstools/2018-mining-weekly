KOLKATA (miningweekly.com) – The Indian government on Thursday accorded ex-post ratification of a bi-lateral agreement between India and Zimbabwe for collaboration in mining, geology and mineral resources. According to an official statement issued by India’s Union Cabinet, the decision approved the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the two countries last month, which envisages exchanging information of resources, mining laws and policy, transferring technologies and promoting investment opportunities. The bi-lateral agreement will also take up activities like documentation and dissemination, as well as a focus on innovation in mining and minerals. “The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the approval of the MoU for cooperation in field of geology, mining and mineral resources as laid down in the agreement signed between the two countries on November 3, 2018, and provide for an institutional mechanism for cooperation in the identified fields,” the Indian government statement said. As a follow-up of the agreement, a 20-member delegation of Indian investors would be visiting Zimbabwe early next year to explore investment opportunities in the African nation in areas of mining and minerals, government officials said. Sources in Indian government said that that several changes in the Zimbabwean mining industry since change of government in the African nation had been taken positively, leading to the bi-lateral agreement, particularly the legislative environment that removed the clause of mandatory local listing of foreign mining companies. The source said that since a government-to-government framework had been established between the two countries it was expected that Indian State-run mining companies like Coal India Limited, Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL), National Aluminium Company Limited (Nalco) and Mineral Exploration Company Limited (MECL) would take the lead in following up the bi-lateral collaboration agreement. In fact, the newly floated joint venture of Nalco, HCL and MECL, christened Khanij Videsh India Limited, exclusively dedicated to scout for mineral investment opportunities overseas and diversify from existing operations of each of these joint venture partners was expected to start diligence into investments windows in Zimbabwe following the approval of the bi-lateral agreement.
