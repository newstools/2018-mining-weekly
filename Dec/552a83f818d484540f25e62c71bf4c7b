Trading in Randgold Resources on the LSE and Nasdaq will cease on December 31, as its $6.1-billion share-for-share merger with Barrick Gold cleared its last major milestone. The Royal Court of Jersey on Monday sanctioned the scheme of arrangement, which will give effect to the merger of the Africa-focused gold mining company with the world’s largest bullion producer. The combined group’s shares will start trading on the NYSE and TSX on January 2, under the Barrick name. Randgold’s Nasdaq trading ticker ‘GOLD’ will be transferred to Barrick on the NYSE. Barrick will continue to trade on the TSX under its existing ‘ABX’ ticker. The court’s approval was the last major milestone that the merger had to pass.
