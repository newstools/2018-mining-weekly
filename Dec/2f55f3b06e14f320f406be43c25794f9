The Harte gold mine – Ontario’s first new gold mine in a decade – is on track to achieve commercial production by the end of the year. Toronto- and Frankfurt-listed Harte Gold said on Tuesday that the Sugar Zone mill complex was achieving consistent throughput of 575 t/d. More than 24 000 t of material had been processed through the mill year-to-date. The mill was being fed from higher grade underground material and the surface stockpile, but Harte said that would transition to solely underground material by early 2019. The mine has an indicated mineral resource of 2.6-million tonnes, grading 8.52 g/t gold for 714 200 oz contained gold and an inferred mineral resource of 3.59-million tonnes, grading 6.59 g/t for 760 800 oz contained gold. Harte has completed infill drilling and it expects to announce a significant upgrade in the tonnes and grade of indicated mineral resources in the first quarter of 2019. It is planning further exploration in 2019. The Harte mine was officially opened in late October.
