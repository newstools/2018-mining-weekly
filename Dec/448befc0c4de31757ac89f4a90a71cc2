The La Parrilla crusher plant has achieved mechanical completion, paving the way for the commissioning of mined ore from the Spain-based tungsten/tin mine in January. The 350 t/h crushing circuit, supplied by Metso Minerals Portugal, comprises a jaw crusher and secondary cone crusher both with vibrating grizzlies prior to size reduction and two tertiary cone crushers in closed circuit with a double deck banana screen. Aim-listed W Resources said on Monday that the circuit had been designed for modular expansion to 700 t/h requiring no modifications to the installed infrastructure and was configured to feed X-ray ore sorting going forwards. The crushing plant – the first of three La Parrilla plants to be completed – would contribute to an increase in production rates from La Parrilla, in line with its planned ramp-up programme. Last month, the company started producing tungsten concentrate, using an existing concentrator and tailings feed. The first shipment left the mine last week. La Parrilla is planned to operate at run rate of 2 500 t/y of tungsten concentrate.
