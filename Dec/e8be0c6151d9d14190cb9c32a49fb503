KINSHASA – Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) collected $1.21-billion in revenues from its mining sector over the first nine months of 2018, an increase of 147.4% over the same period last year, finance ministry data showed. Revenues from the hydrocarbons sector rose 1.4% over that same period to $120.11-million, according to the data seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The two sectors together account for roughly 95% of Congo’s export revenues. Congo is Africa’s leading copper producer and the world’s top miner of cobalt, which is prized for its use in electric batteries.
