Mining Indaba, which will be held at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from February 4 to 7, will introduce a new feature for 2019 – the Leaders of Tomorrow competition. The competition is part of the event’s young leaders programme, which is being produced in partnership with Brunswick. “The competition builds on our drive to support young talent in the mining industry and help close the skills gap,” states organisers Mining Indaba MD Alex Grose. Industry professionals under 35, who have led a major discovery or innovation in the last two years, with projects moving the industry forward in the fields of safety, water, exploration, mineral recovery and strategy, are eligible to enter the competition by December 15. Four finalists will be chosen to present their ten-minute pitches to the judges on the main stage at the Mining Indaba. The winner will be awarded with mentoring time from each of the judges over the following 12 months to support their career progression, as well as other prizes and publicity opportunities. The judges for the competition will be Franco-Nevada director and Nevada Copper director Tom Albanese, Brunswick partner and Nyrstar nonexecutive director Carole Cable, and University of the Witwatersrand principal and vice-chancellor Professor Adam Habib.
