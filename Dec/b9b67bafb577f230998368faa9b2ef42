Development of the Cononish gold and silver mine started on Wednesday, following confirmation from the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Planning Authority (NPA) that all 19 pre-start conditions to the planning application have been discharged. London-listed Scotgold said that it planned the first rock breaking activities at the mine portal early in the New Year. The NPA approved the Cononish mine’s planning application in October. The mine will produce 23 500 oz/y.
