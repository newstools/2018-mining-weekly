Australia's Mineral Resources on Friday signed a binding deal to sell a stake in its Wodgina Lithium Project and form a lithium joint venture with US-based Albemarle Corp for $1.15-billion. The deal allows Albemarle Corp, the world's top lithium producer, to expand its presence in Australia at a time when demand for lithium is expected to boom. Albemarle will take a 50% stake in the joint venture that will own and operate the Wodgina mine and develop a plant producing lithium hydroxide.
