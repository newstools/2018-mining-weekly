The Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada’s (PDAC's) board has hired Lisa McDonald, who served as its COO for ten years, as its new executive director. Over the past year, she has acted as executive director on an interim basis. PDAC states that McDonald is considered one of the key drivers behind the expansion of the yearly PDAC Convention in Toronto. As the director of convention from 2001 to 2008, McDonald played an integral role in growing the event into what is now considered the world’s premier mineral exploration and mining event, attracting more than 25 000 attendees from 135 countries.
