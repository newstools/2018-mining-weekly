Under the mandate, KfW IPEX-Bank will structure, coordinate, lead, arrange and manage a syndicate to raise the targeted amount to underpin the project financing package. The mandate will start on January 15. “We are delighted to have secured a specialised world-class bank partner for a world-class project. We are extremely pleased to have achieved this outcome with KfW IPEX-Bank, which follows extensive reviews and meetings in Europe, Singapore and at the company’s head office over the past 12 months,” said TNG MD Paul Burton. The final capital requirements for the Mt Peake project will be determined and optimised during the ongoing Mt Peake front-end engineering and design study, and during the lender’s due diligence.
