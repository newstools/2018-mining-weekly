ASX-listed MOD Resources has announced additional results from widely spaced drilling at the T23 Dome, of the company’s exploration joint venture project with Aim-listed Metal Tiger, in Botswana. The third drill hole at T23 has intersected zones of visible, finely disseminated copper sulphides within a wide interval from about 85 m to 385 m down hole depth. This type of mineralisation was also intersected in the first two holes at T23, which was announced in November. The third hole, for which assay results are being analysed, also intersected a strongly mineralised vein at 268 m down hole depth, confirming the potential for high-grade copper mineralisation, similar to other copper discoveries in the Kalahari copperbelt, in Botswana. “While we are still at an early stage of exploring the T23 Dome, we are encouraged by the first drilling results. Having confirmed the prospectivity of this area, our exploration team has started testing the potential for high-grade mineralisation within specific structures defined by the electromagnetic data. “MOD’s discovery in March 2016, which is now the T3 copper project, followed by recent successes at the A4 and A1 Domes, and now the T23 Dome, suggests the Central Structural Corridor, which links all these occurrences, may represent one of the largest, most underexplored district-scale targets for sediment-hosted copper,” said MD Julian Hanna.
