Engineering group DRA Global has implemented an advanced milling control system, using the MillSlicer instrument, at the Asanko gold mine, on the Asankrangwa belt, in Ghana. Since the installation, Asanko has been able to deliver above its five-million-tonne-a-year design rate. DRA’s technical processing specialists collaborated with Asanko’s owner team to develop a control system solution that is able to produce real-time reporting and enable the mill operators to better optimise the milling process, since unplanned or forced mill stoppages often lead to costly setbacks. DRA process senior VP Val Coetzee said in a release that the MillSlicer control instrument provides accurate signals through a number of strategically positioned vibration sensors that are used by DRA’s control specialists to develop bespoke control systems that are specific to an operation. The milling control system at Asanko uses propriety rule-based algorithms that assists the mine operation with superior control, which maximises energy efficiency and ensures continual optimal mill performance, despite changes in mine fragmentation or ore type variances. DRA can provide remote operational support, data analysis and reporting to assist clients in reducing liner damage, media consumption and ensure that mill operators efficiently maximise throughput at all times.
