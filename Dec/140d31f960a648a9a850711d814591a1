PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Uranium developer Vimy Resources will undertake further drilling work at its Angularli uranium deposit, in the Northern Territory, after a scoping study proved positive. The project has an inferred mineral resource of 0.91-million tonnes, at 1.3% uranium oxide for 26-million pounds of uranium. “The high-grade nature of the Angularli deposit provides us with the opportunity to develop a tier one asset, with the potential to be profitable in any uranium market,” said Vimy MD and CEO Mike Young. “Given the prospectivity of the Angularli deposit and the recent encouraging drilling results at the nearby Such Wow prospect, I’m confident the Angularli area will grow to become a significant part of our project portfolio.” The scoping study at Angularli considered a conventional long-hole open stoping operation, allowing for the underground mine workings to be used for the disposal of all processing tailings. The underground mining operation would run for some 36 months after a pre-production mine development period of around 12 months, with the remaining open stopes used for tailings paste backfill, Vimy said. With the scoping study now completed, the Vimy board has approved the next stage of exploration and development for Angularli, if budget allowed. Ore sorting trials will also be undertaken to evaluate the potential increase in the head grade to the processing plant, and allow a reduction in the mine cut-off grade. Further resource drilling will also be carried out to improve the confidence of the existing mineral resource.
