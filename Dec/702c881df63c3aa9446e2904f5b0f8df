Midtier gold and copper miner Aura Minerals has suspended mining operations at its San Andres mine, in Honduras, following another illegal invasion by a number of individuals. The illegal occupation follows a similar event earlier this year, which in July led to the company laying off 44 employees, including senior managers, as it suspended all non-vital operations. In October, after another invasion, Aura lowered its production guidance for the mine to between 55 000 oz and 65 000 oz for 2018. Aura said on Monday that it would not be adjusting its guidance at this stage. "We are obviously extremely disappointed and frustrated that we have experienced another invasion from a small number of individuals. These illegal actions are having a disastrous impact on the local communities, employees, vendors and contractors. We have the support of the communities shown through local agreements and a number of large community marches,” said Aura president and CEO Rodrigo Barbosa. The company stated that it was cautiously confident that the Ministerio Público and local police would enforce the rule of law in Honduras; however until such time as a satisfactory outcome was achieved, operations would remain suspended. Heap leach operations are continuing.
