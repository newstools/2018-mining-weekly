PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining and gold production will be accelerated at the Edna Beryl gold mine, in the Northern Territory, with ASX-listed Emmerson Resources and partner Territory Resources unveiling plans to develop and restart mining of high grade ores at the Tribute area. Territory Resources purchased the Edna Beryl Mining Company (EBMC) as part of a larger strategic alliance with Emmerson, under which Territory also became a shareholder in Emmerson. “The purchase of EBMC by Territory is a fantastic outcome for all concerned as it provides a quick route to the mining of high-grade gold, establishing for the first time commercial production from the Edna Beryl mine via the refurbished Warrego mill or third-party processing routes,” said Emmerson MD Rob Bills. The Northern Territory government recently approved plans for a dewatering pipeline, which would allow for an extension and additional development of the Edna Beryl mine. Bills said that this approval was instrumental in extending the underground development and establishing an exploration drive at Edna Beryl, providing an effective platform to drill test the multiple subparallel ironstones, some of which have yielded high-grade gold from surface drilling. He noted that once the dewatering of the Edna Beryl workings was complete, reinstallation of the mining infrastructure would allow for the resumption of mining. Given that the refurbishment of Territory’s Warrego Mill is scheduled for commissioning in the first half of 2019, ore mined from Edna Beryl will either be stockpile, or temporarily toll treated off site. Under the alliance agreement, Emmerson will receive 12% of the gold dore produced.
