Following the office award of the permit for the Monchetundra mine in Russia, Aim-listed Eurasia Mining said on Friday that it would have to pay a 20.84-million rouble licence fee. Twenty per cent of the total is due within 30 days of registration of the licence at the state register of suboil licences. The remaining 80% is payable within five years of the date of the licenceâ€™s registration. Eurasia said that the official document would be transferred to the company in the coming weeks and that it would pay the initial 20% from available funds. The balance would be met as part of the capital development of the project. Monchetundra contains a state approved reserve and resource of about two-million ounces of palladium equivalent, with an in-situ total reserve and resource value of about $2.1-billion. The project is fully permitted for mining.
