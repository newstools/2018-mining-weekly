PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Australia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) resources could assist in decreasing global greenhouse gas emissions, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) said on Tuesday. In reference to the yearly United Nations Climate Change Conference, Appea CEO Dr Malcolm Roberts said on Tuesday that substituting LNG for more emissions-intensive fuels would allow importing countries to satisfy growing demand, while reducing emissions. “When replacing other fuels, LNG can cut emissions by up to 50%. LNG also helps developing countries to reduce air pollution, a major cause of millions of premature deaths.” Roberts said Australia’s LNG projects would deliver decades of economic growth, jobs and exports, as well as strong regional and global environmental benefits. “The latest government estimate suggests that Australia’s LNG exports have the potential to save importing countries 130-million tonnes of emissions per year,” Roberts said. This conservative estimate equates to nearly a quarter of Australia’s total emissions and is more than the entire emissions from the Australian transport and waste sectors combined. “Climate change is a global problem that needs a global solution,” Roberts said. “Changing the energy mix with more use of cleaner fuels and renewables is the only way to meet growing demand without soaring emissions.” Australia’s LNG export earnings increased 36% to A$31.7-billion in 2017/18 and are forecast to reach A$48.4-billion in 2018/19, according to the figures recently released by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science.
