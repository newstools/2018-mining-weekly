Investing in African Mining Indaba is set to host its third Investment Battlefield competition during its twenty-fifth edition of the event from February 4 to 6, 2019. Event organisers are looking for sub-Saharan Africa’s most promising mining companies with a market capitalisation of $50-million or below. This year’s shortlist will be invited to give ‘Dragons’ Den’ style, five-minute pitches in front of a live audience and a panel of top judges, including senior representatives from JP Morgan Asset Management, VanEck, the International Finance Corporation and Orion Resource Partners. Judges will provide instant feedback and featured projects will be grouped together depending on their commodity and lifecycle stage. According to Mining Indaba investor relations director Kael O’Sullivan, “it is important for junior mining entrepreneurs to be given this opportunity to gain exposure and build relationships with investors and brokers”. The competition not only allows junior miners to receive first-hand feedback from the investors themselves, but provides them with an opportunity to learn what investors are looking for, how to increase their appeal and gives them an opportunity to present themselves as leading emerging developers and miners. “We want to encourage every entrepreneurial junior mining company to consider what they can add to the competition. Somewhere out there is the next big investment opportunity that could transform the mining industry in Africa and investors are very keen to discover it,” he added, encouraging junior miners to participate. Mining Indaba awards the winner with a free exhibition stand and speaking slot at Mining Indaba 2020, as well as multiple publicity and investor relations service opportunities.
