London-listed Ferrexpo has rewarded its shareholders with a special interim dividend of 6.6c a share, as premiums for high-quality iron-ore pellets remain high. The company has generated sufficient cash to reduce its debt and to fund its capital expenditure requirements, it said on Thursday, announcing that it would return $40-million to shareholders in the form of a special interim dividend. In 2017, Ferrexpo declared a special interim dividend of 3.3c a share, or $20-million. The miner, which operates in Ukraine, stated that its board would consider the final dividend for 2018 ahead of the full-year results on March 20, 2019.
