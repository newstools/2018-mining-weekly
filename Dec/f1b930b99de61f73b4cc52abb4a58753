PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Aluminium major Alcoa has secured three new gas supply agreements that will supply 25% of the company’s Western Australian gas requirements from 2020. Alcoa has struck agreements with providers BHP, Woodside and Chevron, and coupled with existing supply contracts with Santos and Quadrant Energy, the company has now completed its gas portfolio to fuel its Kwinana, Pinjarra nd Wagerup alumina refineries in the mid-term. “In securing these new gas contracts, we are demonstrating to our employees, suppliers, customers and the communities where we operate our commitment to the state,” said Alcoa Alumina president and MD of Alcoa Australia, Michael Parker. “Alcoa’s three Western Australian refineries are the largest integrated sources of alumina globally and an important source of economic activity. They provide jobs for more than 3 000 Western Australians, primarily in the state’s south west, and generate some $1.4-billion in expenditure with Western Australian suppliers,” Parker said. Alcoa is also Western Australia’s single largest user of natural gas, consuming some 40% of the gas supplied to the southwest of the state, and around 25% of the state’s total domestic gas supply.
