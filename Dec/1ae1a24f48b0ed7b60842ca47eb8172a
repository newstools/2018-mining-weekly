Côte d'Ivoire plans to double gold production by 2025, its VP said on Monday, as the west African country strives to revive its long-neglected mining sector. Côte d'Ivoire, the world's top cocoa producer, is seeking to diversify revenues by increasing gold output from 25 t last year to 50 t between 2020 and 2025, said Daniel Kablan Duncan at the opening of an Ecowas meeting on mining and petroleum in the commercial capital Abidjan. Mining sector turnover rose by 11.5% in 2017, an increase achieved mainly via exports of gold, manganese and nickel.
