ASX- and Aim-listed Thor Miningâ€™s Desert Scheelite deposit at Pilot Mountain, in Nevada, has a mineral resource estimate of 10.7-million tonnes at 0.26% tungsten trioxide, 19.38 g/t silver, 0.15% copper and 0.38% zinc. The updated mineral resource estimate represents a 6.5% increase in the scheelite inventory for the project, now containing 27 700 t of tungsten trioxide, of which 85% is in the indicated category. The planned flotation recovery process that Thor will use is currently being trialled and is likely to recover zinc sulphides into concentrate with minimal additional cost. Meanwhile, the company states that the resource inventory still has considerable growth potential through the Gun Metal and Good Hope deposits, as well as further potential upside at both Desert Scheelite and Garnet.
