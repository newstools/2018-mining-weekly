Dual-listed Sibanye-Stillwater on Tuesday said the situation at its Beatrix gold operations, in the Free State, were tense amid continuing violent actions by groups allegedly affiliated to the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU). “In the early hours of December 11, various altercations between the South African Police Service and large groups of AMCU members resulted in a number of employees being injured,” the gold miner said in a statement. Several employees were receiving medical treatment, with one person in a critical condition. “The situation at Beatrix operations, in particular, remain tense, with striking workers continuing to intimidate nonstriking workers, causing damage to company property and restricting access to the company’s operating mine sites,” Sibanye said.
