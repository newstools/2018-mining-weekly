Tungsten, copper and gold miner W Resources has successfully fed the first mined ore into the newly completed crusher, which is now being commissioned at its La Parrilla tungsten and tin project, in Spain. "First ore into new crusher was achieved on December 18, 2018, ahead of the January 2019 target and is a great credit to the team at La Parrilla,” said W chairperson Michael Masterman. The crusher plant will contribute to an increase in production rates from La Parilla, which last month started producing tungsten concentrate, using an existing concentrator and tailings feed. La Parrilla is planned to operate at run rate of 2 500 t/y of tungsten concentrate.
