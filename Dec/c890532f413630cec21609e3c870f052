Two of Herencia Resources' shareholders have agreed to advance $120 000 to the company, which the Aim-listed firm said on Tuesday would provide sufficient funds through to the end of January. The Chile-focused junior explorer and developer warned, though, that its working capital position continued to be constrained. The two shareholders are the Australian Special Opportunity Fund (Lind Partners) and Oriental Darius. Each would advance $60 000. The company explained that the shareholders would provide the capital by way of a secured convertible facility with a face value of $144 000, which is the agreed amount to be repaid over a 24-month term. Herencia owns the Picachos/Pastizal, Guamanga and La Serena copper projects.
