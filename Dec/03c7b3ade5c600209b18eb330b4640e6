The Administrative Court of Armenia has accepted Lydian International’s lawsuit appealing a directive by the head of the Environmental and Mining Inspection Body, which ordered a stop to mining-related activities at the Amulsar project, owing to sightings of newly-found red-listed plants and animal species. The acceptance of the lawsuit resulted in an “automatic suspension” of the directive issued by the head of the unit, Artur Grigoryan, until the appeal is heard and determined, the TSX-listed company said on Monday. Lydian was previously directed to suspend any mining-related activities until the Ministry of Nature Protection conducted a study to determine if Grigoryan’s assertion that Acantholimon caryophyllaceum Boiss plant species and Parnassius apollo animal species had been identified at the Amulsar project site for the first time. Lydian stated that the study commissioned by the Ministry of Nature Protection had confirmed the non-existence of the red-listed plant and animal species and concluded that the Amulsar project site did not include the necessary habitat to support either species. However, despite the suspension of the directive, Lydian can still not resume full construction activities at the site, as illegal blockades continue to hamper progress. Lydian has secured short-term access to undertake winterisation and preservation work on process and mobile equipment. Amulsar will be a large-scale operation with production targeted to average about 225 000 oz/y over an initial ten-year mine life.
