Mining at the Waihi operation in New Zealand will continue for at least another decade, adding to a long history of gold mining that dates back to the 1800s, Melbourne-headquartered OceanaGold has confirmed, announcing that it has received preliminary approval for its Martha project. OceanaGold reported this week that an independent panel of commissioners appointed by the Hauraki district council and the Waikato regional council had granted all resource consents for the Martha underground mine and for the resumption of mining from Stage 4 of the Martha openpit. The approvals are subject to the outcome of a statutory appeal period, which runs until February 1. OceanaGold president and CEO Mick Wilkes commented that the approvals represented a “great outcome” for the company, the town of Waihi. “Waihi has had a long rich history of gold mining that dates back to the 1800s and since then over 11-million ounces of gold have been produced in the Coromandel. More recently, since 1988 when mining commenced at the Martha openpit, the Waihi operation has been a major employer in the region and has contributed a significant amount of socio-economic benefits while operating to the highest of environmental standards globally." In August, OceanaGold announced a significant increase in the mineral resources for the Martha project, lifting the total indicated resource by 700% to 0.76-million tonnes at 5.8 g/t gold for 140 000 oz. The total inferred resource increased by 250% to 2.49-million tonnes at 4.3 g/t for 339 000 oz. Waihi employs 350 people and contributes about 40% to the local economy.
