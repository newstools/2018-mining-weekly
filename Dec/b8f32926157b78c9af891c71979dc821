The Brucejack gold mine, in British Columbia, has received approval to increase its production rate to 3 800 t/y, TSX- and NYSE-listed Pretium Resources reported on Friday. The amended permits from the British Columbia Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Ministry allow for production to increase to 1.387-million tonnes a year, from 0.99-million tonnes a year, or 2 700 t/d. Pretium said that it would schedule minor upgrades to support the new production rate during regular mill shutdowns. These upgrades would cost C$25-million. The company aims to ramp up its output to 3 800 t/d in the first quarter of next year. The Brucejack mine is forecast to produce between 387 000 oz and 407 000 oz in 2018.
