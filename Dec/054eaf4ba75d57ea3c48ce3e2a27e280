Canada-based Alamos Gold late on Thursday reported a serious accident at its Mulatos mine, in Mexico, which has likely cost the lives of two of its workers. The accident involved an unexpected pit slope movement in the El Salto area of the openpit, where pre-stripping activities were being conducted, the miner explained in a news release. At the time of issuing the release, two of Alamos’ employees were missing and presumed dead. Rescue efforts were under way. “We are profoundly saddened by this accident. The safety of our employees is our highest priority and the loss of these two individuals is a shock to us all. We extend our deepest sympathy to their families and loved ones,” said president and CEO John McCluskey.
