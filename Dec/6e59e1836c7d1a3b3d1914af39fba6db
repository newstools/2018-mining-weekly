Minerals explorer Boreal Metals is making progress with its Scandinavia projects, the company reported this week, as it wrapped up a drilling programme at Burfjord, in Norway, and announced that it would initiate follow-up drilling at Gumsberg, Sweden. At the early-stage Burfjord prospect, drilling contractor Arctic Drilling has completed seven diamond drill holes totalling 951 m. Boreal said that it expected to receive assay result in the coming weeks. In Sweden, Boreal appointed Arctic Drilling to conduct a diamond drilling at Gumsberg to follow up on previous high-grade intercepts.  The planned 1 000 m reconnaissance drill programme would start in early December and would test a variety of shallow drill targets. "The goal of this programme is to conduct an efficient test of several high priority targets in the vicinity of the Östra Silvberg mine, where we had good success earlier this year,” said Boreal president and CEO Karl Antonius. Östra Silvberg was the largest silver mine in Sweden between 1250 and 1590.
