Following the completion of the 2018 drilling programme, TSX-V- and ASX-listed Euro Manganese has updated the resource estimate of its Chvaletice manganese project, in the Czech Republic, confirming 98.3% as measured resources. The project's total measured and indicated resources now amount to 26.96-million tonnes, grading 7.33% total manganese and 5.86% soluble manganese. Euro Manganese president and CEO Marco Romero says the updated resource estimate will provide a foundation for detailed planning of the tailings extraction and processing schemes, and drive the project economics in the upcoming preliminary economic assessment, which is expected in early 2019. During the 2018 metallurgical testwork programme and pilot plant tests, the company’s in-house team made progress in advancing its understanding of the Chvaletice deposit and in the planning and design of a technically-viable process flowsheet. “By recycling the Chvaletice waste, we are targeting production of some of the highest purity electrolytic manganese metal and manganese sulphate monohydrate available in the world today, while setting the stage for compliance with very high health, safety and environmental standards,” says Romero. The company reports that planning is under way to design, build and commission a demonstration plant in the Czech Republic to provide bulk, multi-tonne finished product samples for customer tests and qualification. The plant is also expected to serve as a testing and training facility for future operations.
