PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed Titan Minerals has completed the construction of its plant and mill at its Vista gold project, in Southern Peru, on schedule and budget. The company is currently receiving ore at the plant to establish stockpiles for initial testing and dry commissioning of the plant over the coming months. When fully commissioned, the Vista plant will have a nameplate capacity of 150 t/d, more than tripling the operating capacity of the existing Tulin plant. At nameplate capacity, Vista is expected to generate up to 90 oz/d based on monthly average grades of 17.5 g/t to 24.4 g/t at the Tulin plant, over the past six months. Dry commissioning of the Vista crushing and grinding circuits is planned for December.
