Diversified major Rio Tinto has completed the sale of its aluminium smelter at Dunkerque, France, to Liberty House for $500-million. Liberty House, which is part of the GFG Alliance (Gupta Family Group), has committed to continuing operations at the smelter and has announced plans for the development of additional activity around the site. The proceeds of the sale will be returned to shareholders, with the precise timing and form to be announced with Rio Tinto's 2018 full year results. The transaction was announced in February last year.
