Aim-listed IronRidge Resources has started a 3 000 m reverse circulation (RC) exploration drilling programme at the Abonko target, at the Ewoyaa lithium project, in Ghana. A 1 000 m diamond drilling programme is planned on completion of the RC drilling programme, for density, metallurgical testwork sampling, geotechnical and RC drill hole twinning for resource estimate signoff at Ewoyaa. “We are pleased with the progress of field activities at the Cape Coast lithium portfolio. We are advancing on multiple fronts including exploration and resource drilling, implementing metallurgical sampling and testwork programmes and advancing regional exploration programmes. "Ongoing pitting has confirmed significant strike extensions at Ewoyaa which has the potential to deliver additional pegmatite volumes and will be drill tested as part of this programme,” commented CEO and MD Vincent Mascolo.
