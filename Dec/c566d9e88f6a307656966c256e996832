Global energy company Total and the Mauritanian Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Mines have signed an agreement that awards Total two new exploration and production contracts for blocks C15 and C31, which are deep offshore Mauritania. The contracts cover an area of 14 175 km2 and will be 90% owned by Total, with 10% owned by Société Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures et de Patrimoine Minier. Combined with its participation interest and operatorship in blocks C7, C9 and C18, the award of the new blocks strengthens Total’s position in the emerging hydrocarbons basin offshore Mauritania. “This agreement contributes to the implementation of Total’s strategy that aims to explore basins in proven yet underexplored petroleum systems,” said Total exploration and production president Arnaud Breuillac. He added that the addition of the blocks to the company’s existing positions demonstrates its commitment to the development of the Mauritanian oil sector and will enhance Total’s presence in West Africa – one of Total’s core exploration areas. From Mauritania to Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire and Nigeria, this core area comprises half of Total’s acreage in Africa, as the Mauritanian basin remains one of the most promising. According to its exploration programme, Total plans to drill a well on block C9 in 2019.
