PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Ore production from the Far West underground mine, at the Thalanga zinc project, in Queensland, is expected to start in the first quarter of 2019. Owner Red River Resources on Tuesday reported that ore from the Far West underground would augment the West 45 ore, and would increase production at Thalanga. “The Far West deposit will extend production at Thalanga operations for at least the next five years. Production from Far West is on track to start in the first quarter of 2019 and we are planning further drilling to target extensions of the high-grade mineralisation in early 2019,” said Red River MD Mel Palancian. The Far West mine is Red River’s second underground mine, and is estimated to host a mineral resource of 1.6-million tonnes, grading 1.6% copper, 2.1% lead and 6.5% zinc, and a reserve of 1.5-million tonnes, grading 12% zinc equivalent, and has a mine life to 2025.
