PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Copper miner Finders Resources has reported a wail failure at its Kali Kuning openpit mine, at the Wetar copper project, in Indonesia. The company on Monday said some 175 000 bank cubic meters of waste rock from the north-eastern highwall were displaced into the pit on June 14, with mining operations suspended for around six hours the following day, to allow for a geotechnical assessment. Finders told shareholders that the footprint of the slip has temporarily isolated around 40 000 bank cubic meters of ore, however, the majority of the orebody remained unaffected by the failure and mining continued in the central and southern zones, as planned. The company noted that at this stage, there was no disruption anticipated to scheduled ore production, and a recovery plan for rehabilitating the failure zone and accessing the affected ore is under way. The recovery plan will likely be executed using the current mining fleet.
