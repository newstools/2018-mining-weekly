South Africa's economic growth prospects will be limited by weak business confidence while uncertainty around land and mining reforms remain a concern for investors, ratings agency Moody's said in research report on Tuesday. "Uncertainty over how this (land reform) will be achieved continues to limit near-term investment," said Moody's analyst and senior credit officer Lucie Villa. "(It) could ultimately lead to a more pronounced fall in investment should the final terms of land reform be particularly onerous to businesses."
