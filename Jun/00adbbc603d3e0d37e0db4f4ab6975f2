KOLKATA (miningweekly.com) – In a bid to offer explorers the option of maximizing production, India’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry has permitted oil and natural gas exploration projects to extend operations beyond geographically demarcated contract areas in instances where discoveries are contiguous and stretch beyond such demarcated areas. At the same time, the Director General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has been empowered to determine “excusable delays and excess cost recoveries” by a contracted exploration agency. A document titled, ‘Policy Framework for Streamlining the Operations, Relaxation and Timelines’ issued by the Ministry states, “firms can take a petroleum exploration licence (PEL) area beyond their awarded block boundaries to ascertain the extent of commercial discovery provided such area is not of strategic importance or such area has not been awarded to any other company by the government, nor is it held by any other party, or not on offer by the government”. The policy document also simplified the process of any exploratory firm to pay for unfinished, but committed exploration and drilling work before taking up next phase of production and development to ensure that such firms are able to quickly complete development and production of area where exploration had already been completed. At the same time, to eliminate discretion and delays in determining what constituted “excusable delays” in exploration parameters, without making exploration agencies liable to pay penalties, the policy stipulated that DGH would set up a multi-disciplinary committee to review and d proposals for approval of “excusable delays” based on specific definition of such delays to be laid down by the regulator. Under production sharing contracts (PSCs) between exploration contractors and the government, the former would not be allowed cost recovery unless the multi-disciplinary committee of the DGH ratified that cost increases were due to circumstances that came into existence after the PSC was signed. However, it had now been decided that DGH would be empowered to determine  permission for cost recovery in such cases where excess cost recovery up to 20%.
