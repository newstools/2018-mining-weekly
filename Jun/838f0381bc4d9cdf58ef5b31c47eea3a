SANTIAGO â€“ Unionised workers at BHP Billiton's Spence copper mine in northern Chile have approved a new labor contract, union president Ronald Salcedo said on Monday. Spence is one of the Anglo-Australian miner two mines in Chile. The other, Escondida, the world' largest copper mine, earlier this month entered into labour negotiations following a historic strike that shut down the mine for 44 days last year, depriving BHP of $1-billion in production. Salcedo said the 36-month contract at Spence, which includes a one-time bonus of nearly $21 500 per worker, was approved by 87% of the union's approximately 900 members. The deal also includes a 2% increase over current base salaries, Salcedo said. BHP is spending $2.46-billion to extend the life of Spence by more than 50 years, creating up to 5 000 jobs and bringing new output online from 2021. Spence produced 198 600 t of copper in 2017.
