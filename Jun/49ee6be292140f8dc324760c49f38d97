Coal miner Wescoal has entered into sale agreements with Tokata Resources and Banjosign to dispose of its Intibane 1 and Intibane 2 collieries, in Mpumalanga. The disposal will become effective on or about July 1. The Intibane Complex comprises the Intibane 1 and Intibane 2 opencast collieries. With the remaining coal reserve at the Intibane Complex being less than the annual production rate, the disposal is in line with Wescoalâ€™s strategy of realising value for shareholders and building a scalable, sustainable business, the company said on Thursday. The total consideration for the disposal is about R57-million in cash, which is payable by August 31. The consideration, which will be used to reduce the short-term borrowings of the group and to fund strategic growth options, is to be settled through a R39-million payment by Tokata for the mining operations and assets of Intibane Complex, and a R18-million payment by Banjosign for the surface rights of the Intibane Complex. The value of the net assets that are the subject of the disposal is R39-million, Wescoal said, and the profits attributable to the net assets that are the subject of the disposal, is R37-million for the year ended March 31.
