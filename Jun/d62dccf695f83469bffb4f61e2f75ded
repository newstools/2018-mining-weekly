BRASILIA â€“ Brazil's President Michel Temer will issue two decrees on Tuesday introducing stricter rules on miners for the recovery of degraded areas and compensating municipalities affected by mining that takes place elsewhere, the Mines and Energy Ministry said. The overhaul of the decades-old mining code includes measures to allow for mining titles to be used as guarantees for financing, aimed at stimulating investment in sector, and to allow miners to continue to explore for minerals while production licence applications are pending, the ministry said. Reuters reported first on the presidential measures last week.
