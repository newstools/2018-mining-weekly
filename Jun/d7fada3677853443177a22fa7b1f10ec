PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior PepinNini Lithium has reported an initial 600 000 t lithium carbonate and 270 000 t potash measured and indicated resource for its Rincon project, in Argentina. An additional 6 000 t of lithium carbonate and 26 000 t of potash is also classified in the inferred category. “We are very excited to see an initial Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant resource estimate from our hydrogeological consultants. The company now has a first defined resource estimate in place for our lithium project, which given the current price of lithium carbonate equivalent is a valuable resource,” said PepinNini MD Rebecca Holland-Kennedy. “It forms the basis for subsequent resource estimates from our other projects to allow us to continue to advance to the next level of development for lithium production.”
