JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) - The environmental certificate for mineral exploration company OreCorp's Nyanzaga gold project, in the Lake Victoria Goldfields of Tanzania, has been granted, the company announced on Wednesday. The certificate, which is a culmination of over 18 month's work by the company, stakeholders and in-country consultants, is an essential component for the grant of a special mining licence (SML) and is a significant step forward in the permitting for the project. A definitive feasibility study (DFS) is under way at Nyanzaga, which hosts a Joint Ore Reserves Committee 2012 compliant mineral resource estimate of 3.1-million ounces at 4 g/t gold. The SML application has been lodged and is expected to progress through the application process once the moratorium on the grant of new licences is lifted. The ASX-listed company will provide updates on both the progression of the DFS and SML application, as appropriate.
