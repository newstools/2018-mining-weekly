LONDON – Gold is burnishing its allure to investors in the wake of the recent market turmoil. Investors piled into VanEck’s Vectors Gold Miners exchange-traded fund last week to the tune of $529-million, the most since September 2013. The ETF holds shares of mining companies including Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold. Gold meanwhile rallied after two weeks of declines.
