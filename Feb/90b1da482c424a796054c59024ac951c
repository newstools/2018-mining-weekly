JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – The bodies of two miners have been recovered from the Ikamva 4 shaft at precious metals producer Sibanye-Stillwater’s Kloof gold mine. The miners became trapped after a fall-of-ground incident at 01:30 on Wednesday morning. The company extended condolences to the miners’ families, friends and colleagues. “Operations in the affected area have been suspended pending an investigation into the incident by Sibanye-Stillwater management together with the Department of Mineral Resources and other relevant stakeholders.” The fall-of-ground was possibly linked to a seismic event. The Kloof mine is a complex of intermediate to ultradeep-level mines about 60 km south-west of Johannesburg.
