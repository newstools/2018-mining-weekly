PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium miner Altura Mining has started loading its maiden cargo of 5 000 t of spodumene concentrate at Port Hedland, bound for customers in China. The ASX-listed company said on Thursday that the final product testing of the cargo is ongoing, however, it added that the processing plant has been consistently delivering above specification spodumene concentrate. Altura MD James Brown said the maiden cargo was a major milestone for the company. “However, the hard work does not stop here. We remain focused on the continued ramp-up of Stage 1 production to nameplate capacity over the coming months. Meanwhile, we continue to field enquiries from potential offtake partners and are seeing strong demand from North Asia.” Altura in July produced its first spodumene from the mine, which will produce some 220 000 t/y of 6% lithium concentrate when in full production. Spodumene concentrate from the mine will be stockpiled in a purpose-built storage facility in Port Hedland, which has a capacity of 40 000 t, with Altura presently having the rights to 30 000 t. The company is currently considering plans to double the production of the Pilgangoora operation to 440 000 t/y to tap into the global demand for electric vehicle and static storage batteries.
