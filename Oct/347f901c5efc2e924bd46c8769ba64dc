Emerging gold miner Monarques, which focuses its growth efforts in the Abitibi mining camp of Quebec, has received conditional approval to move its listing to the TSX. The listing is subject to compliance with all TSX requirements by December 30, the company, which is currently listed on the TSX-V, stated on Tuesday. "We are proud to be graduating to the TSX, as it indicates how much Monarques has evolved in the last year," president and CEO Jean-Marc Lacoste said in a statement. "We believe that this move over to the TSX will attract a larger number of investors and funds, including those who may have been restricted from buying our shares. It should also improve our access to capital markets, which could prove to be timely for our Wasamac gold project." The corporation currently owns about 300 kmÂ² of gold properties, including the Wasamac deposit, which has a measured and indicated resource of 2.6-million ounces of gold, the Beaufor mine, the Croinor Gold, McKenzie Break and Swanson advanced projects and the Camflo and Beacon mills, as well as five promising exploration projects. It also offers custom milling services out of its 1 600 t/d Camflo mill.
