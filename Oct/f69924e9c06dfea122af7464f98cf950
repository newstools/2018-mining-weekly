The ground-based geophysics survey over a portion of Aim-listed exploration and development group URU Metals’ Zebediela nickel/sulphide project, in Limpopo, has been completed. The purpose of the programme was to assist with the accurate placement of further planned exploration drill holes and to help gain a better understanding of the geology of the area. Preliminary interpretations have been received from the appointed geophysics consultants, Gap Geophysics. The programme comprised 11 survey lines, totalling 19.6 km of time induced polarisation and resistivity plus ground magnetometer survey, which was designed to detect mineralisation and geological contacts. Preliminary results show geological contacts associated with mineralisation and these can be traced along strike across the project area, allowing for targeting of further exploration drilling, the company said on Tuesday. The next stages of the programme are expected to start in the last quarter of this year and will comprise the integration and three-dimensional modelling of current drilling and geophysical data, a proposed multi-element soil geochemistry survey and a six-hole diamond exploration drilling campaign, and additional geophysical traverses to the north and the south of the existing traverses. “Based on the results received to date, we are confident that we have identified the geological contact that is related to the nickel/platinum group element (PGE) mineralisation and that this contact can be traced along strike, with the ultimate goal of proving up a high-value nickel plus PGE resource close to surface,” CEO John Zorbas commented.
