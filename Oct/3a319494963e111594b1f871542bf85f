JOHANNESBURG – Africa-focused energy company Kibo said on Friday it had submitted its formal tender qualification document to the Tanzania Electricity Supply Company (Tanesco) for the Mbeya coal to power project, in line with the government’s new initiative to develop independent power projects. "Our visionary development approach has allowed us to develop and forge critical strategic partnerships very early on in the process," Kibo Energy CEO Louis Coetzee said. "Having done all the definitive feasibility studies, financial modelling, technical development work and environmental and social impact assessment certification well in advance, we have been able to submit a TQD (tender qualification document) of exceptionally high standard and substance in a very short space of time." Kibo's subsidiary Mbeya Power was invited to tender for generation of up to 600 MW of coal power following the issue of a request for qualification as the first of a two-stage competitive bidding process on September 18. Coetzee said the company now awaited a definitive date for completion of Stage 1 from the government owned Tanesco and expected this to be completed before the end of 2018. The request for qualification called for an undertaking to do a feasibility study, finance, build, own, operate and transfer coal power projects of a capacity not less than 150 MW and not more than 300 MW in one location.
