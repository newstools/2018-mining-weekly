PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) has reported a 36% increase in production during the three months to September, with production reaching 544 t of uranium oxide, up from the 400 t produced in the June quarter. ERA said on Wednesday that the increased production resulted from higher volumes of ore milled as well as increased ore grade. The June quarter was also impacted by annual mill maintenance. ERA has maintained its production guidance for 2018 of between 1 600 t and 2 000 t of uranium oxide. Earlier this month, ERA approved a A$32-million expenditure to expand the dredging capacity at its Ranger project, in the Northern Territory, in order to complete rehabilitation activities within the regulatory timeframe. The additional dredging and tailings infrastructure will be commissioned in the second quarter of 2019, and will support the existing transfer of tailings from the tailings storage facility to Pit 3. The additional costs will be recorded in the December rehabilitation provision.
