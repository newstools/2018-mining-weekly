The Copper Mountain mine, in southern British Columbia, performed in line with expectations in the quarter ended September 30, producing 18.3-million pounds of copper 7 500 oz of gold and 64 900 oz of silver. The company has guided that third-quarter copper production would be 10% lower than the second quarter, owing to lower copper grades being mined. Actual production was 8.5% lower than the second quarter, TSX- and ASX-listed Copper Mountain Mining reported on Thursday. Fourth-quarter copper output would be the strongest of the year, enabling the firm to achieve its 2018 production guidance of 80-million pounds. Copper equivalent production was 22-million pounds and was down 4.8% compared with the second quarter.
