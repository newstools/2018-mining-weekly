Shares of Albemarle Corp fell more than 2% on Monday after a newspaper reported that Chile's nuclear regulator has refused to increase the company's lithium production quota. The report, which has yet to be confirmed by officials, would be a blow to the world's largest lithium producer's aim to increase output of the light metal used to make batteries for electric vehicles. Shares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albermarle were down 2.3% at $100.64 in Monday morning trading. The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN) refused to boost Albemarleâ€™s production quota, even after the company received prior approvals for an increase from state development agency Corfo, according to a story published in the La Tercera newspaper over the weekend. CCHEN representatives could not be reached to independently confirm the report. Albemarle representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
