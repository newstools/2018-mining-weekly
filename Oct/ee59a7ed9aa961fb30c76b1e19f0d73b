NYSE-listed Honeywell and Eurasian Resources Group (ERG) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop innovative technologies that will increase productivity at ERG’s operations in Kazakhstan, Brazil and several African countries. Under the terms of the MoU, Honeywell will initially implement its Symphonite statistical data reconciliation software to help ERG with its production and inventory information reporting process. This will allow personnel to make better decisions, reduce losses and adhere to corporate governance guidelines, states Honeywell. “With our assets spread across Kazakhstan, Africa and Brazil, having reliable, accurate information is imperative to run our operations as efficiently as possible,” says ERG chief information officer Galymzhan Akhmetov.
