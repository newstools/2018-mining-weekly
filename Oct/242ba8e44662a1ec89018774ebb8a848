Eskom Rotek Industries CEO Johnny Dladla, who served a short stint as the group's CEO in 2017, has resigned and will leave Eskom at the end of October to "pursue private business interests".
 
The State-owned utility said in a statement that Dladla's successor would be announced in due course.
 
Dladla has been with Eskom for 23 years, 17 of which he spent in various roles in Eskom's nonregulated businesses, including a five-year period as CEO of Eskom Enterprises and its subsidiaries. He was appointed interim Eskom CEO in June 2017, but was replaced by Sean Maritz in October of that same year on the dubious grounds that Eskom wanted to "rotate" its executives to "ensure exposure". Maritz later resigned under cloud ahead of a planned disciplinary hearing. Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe – who was appointed in February this year as part of efforts to clean-up an entity where governance had been severely undermined during Jacob Zuma's term as President of the country and which remains at the heart of 'State capture' allegations – thanked Dladla for his efforts in helping to stabilise Eskom. A commission of inquiry, led by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has been convened to investigate the extent of State capture across government, including at key State-owned companies such as Eskom and Transnet.
