Aim-listed Arc Minerals on Tuesday reported additional reverse circulation and diamond drill assay results from the company’s 11 000 m drilling programme at the Kalaba prospect, which is part of its Zamsort copper/cobalt project, in Zambia. The results found that mineralisation continues to be intersected in all holes drilled to date, with good thickness. Four new holes, with elevated copper grades ranging between 0.50% and 1% have been discovered, and the disseminated cobalt mineralisation continues to be intersected in the mineralised zones. The results of the drilling programme continue to be very encouraging, said executive chairperson Nick von Schirnding, who added that the drilling, to date, demonstrated that, at Kalaba, the source and migration of the mineralising fluids has been quite extensive. The company is now beginning to intersect some of the higher-grade “traps”. “Given the activity on the ground, as well as the large number of samples that are currently being sent to the lab, we anticipate a strong pipeline of news flow,” he stated.
