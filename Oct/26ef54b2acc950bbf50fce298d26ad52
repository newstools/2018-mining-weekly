Benefitting from a smooth ramp-up and high copper grades at its newest mine, Aktogay, Kazakhstan miner KAZ Minerals is on track to achieve its 2018 copper guidance and will likely touch the upper-end of its gold guidance. The London- and Kazakhstan Stock Exchange-listed company produced 77 200 t of copper, and 45 200 oz of gold in the September 2018 quarter. This is a 7% improvement for copper and 19% improvement for gold on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The consolidated copper production is comprised of 25 200 t from Bozshakol, 34 900 t from Aktogay and 17 100 t from East Region and Bozymchak. “Following a strong third quarter across KAZ Minerals' assets we are well placed to achieve our full year copper production target and the top end of our gold and silver guidance," said CEO Andrew Southam. Kaz Minerals' share price advanced 10% on the London exchange on Thursday.
