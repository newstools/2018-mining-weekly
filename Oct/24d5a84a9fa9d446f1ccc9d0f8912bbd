JOHANNESBURG – Mining company Merafe Resources said on Friday its ferrochrome production from the Glencore Merafe Chrome Venture for the third quarter ended 30 September 2018 increased by 20% to 84 000 t compared with the same period in 2017. Merafe said the increase was as a result of less planned maintenance during the third quarter. Merafe and Glencore South Africa formed the joint venture in July 2004 when the companies pooled their chrome operations to create the largest ferrochrome producer in the world.
