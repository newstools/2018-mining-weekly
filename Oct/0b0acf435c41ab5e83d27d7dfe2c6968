PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Rare earths miner Lynas has been granted an extension of its temporary permission to store NUF at the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant (LAMP), in Malaysia. The company earlier this month warned that its permission to store NUF at the LAMP site would run out at the end of October, with the miner already having lodged an application to license LAMP as a prescribed premises to dispose of the residue. The regulator has now told the company that it is considering the application in accordance with applicable legislation, and in the meantime has granted an extension of the temporary permission to store NUF at the site.
