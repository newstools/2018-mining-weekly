The Star Diamond Corporation has received environmental approval from the Saskatchewan government for its Star-Orion South project, near Prince Albert. The project already has a positive federal environmental assessment decision in the bag. The company recently announced the positive results of the independent preliminary economic assessment on the project, which estimates that 66-million carats of diamonds could be recovered in a surface mine over a 38-year project life. Last year, Star Diamond granted Rio Tinto Exploration Canada (RTEC) an option to earn up to a 60% interest in the company’s Fort à la Corne mineral properties, including the Star-Orion South project.
