TSX-V-listed IDM Mining is back drilling at the Red Mountain mine, west of Stewart, British Columbia, announcing on Tuesday that two core rigs had started operating at the underground project, An estimated 7 600 m in over 30 holes are planned for the exploration programme, which will test four areas: a near-surface synform between the Marc and 141 zones, the northern and western extensions to the Smit and JW zones, a projected high-grade connection between the Smit and 141 zones and the northern and eastern extensions to the SF zone antiform. Further, drilling will target conversion of inferred resources to measured and indicated classification, primarily within the Smit and SF zones. Drilling would be completed by early December and IDM noted that it had a “winterised camp” and shop facility to support the programme. Earlier this month, the provincial government granted the Red Mountain underground project environmental approval, subject to 38 conditions. The mine, located in the Stewart district of the Nass Wildlife Area, is expected to extract 1 000 t a day of ore, with a net production of 365 000 t/y, during the mine’s six-year operational life.
