Iron-ore company Baffinland Iron Mines and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association on Wednesday signed an amended Inuit impact benefit agreement (IIBA) in relation to the Mary River mine, strengthening the company’s commitments to the communities. The miner and communities have jointly committed to enhancing the focus on Inuit training and employment. This will be done through increased skills and training opportunities to provide Nunavummiut with the skills they need to gain meaningful employment at the Mary River. The agreement provides for increased financial commitments to training and skills development, the development of a state-of-the-art training facility in Pond Inlet and the implementation of enhanced pre-employment training opportunities to prepare Inuit for employment at the mine. “The signing of the Amended IIBA represents another major step in our commitment to deliver on our promise to bring employment and training opportunities to the Qikiqtani region,” said Baffinland president and CEO Brian Penney. Baffinland is jointly owned by Nunavut Iron Ore and ArcelorMittal and operates a high-grade iron-ore mine located on Baffin Island, Nunavut.
