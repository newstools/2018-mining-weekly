Canada-based Gran Colombia has marked the fourth consecutive quarter of gold production exceeding 50 000 oz and the first quarter of producing more than 50 000 oz at its Segovia mine alone, executive chairperson Serafino Iacono reported on Monday. The TSX-listed miner produced 57 163 oz of gold in the third quarter of 2018, a 54% improvement on the prior-year period, bringing year-to-date output to 162 741 oz. The company continues to expect that it will produce between 210 000 oz and 220 000 oz in 2018. At the Segovia operations, gold production in September amounted to 17 140 oz, bringing the total for the third quarter of 2018 to 50 968 oz and for the first nine months of 2018 to 144 241 oz, up 40% compared with the first nine months of 2017, which included the adverse impact of the civil disruption on operations in August last year. The Marmato mine produced 1 980 oz of gold in September, bringing the total for the third quarter of 2018 to 6 465 oz and for the first nine months of 2018 to 18 500 oz, about 3% lower than the first nine months of 2017. “We continue to be encouraged by the execution of the development and modernisation programmes within our high-grade Segovia operations, which are fuelling our production and earnings growth,” Iacono said.
