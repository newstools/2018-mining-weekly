PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Graphite miner Syrah Resources has been forced to partially suspend operations at its Balama graphite operation, in Mozambique, following a fire at the primary classifier within the process plant. The fire resulted from hot work activities below the unit during planned maintenance on piping. The fire rendered the primary classifier inoperable, prompting Syrah to source a replacement primary classifier from South Africa. No structural damage was incurred beyond the unit, and all other sections of the plant were stopped in a planned manner. The delivery, installation and commissioning of the new primary classifier is expected to take five weeks. However, Syrah noted on Thursday that mining and crushing activities would continue during the period. The ASX-listed company has estimated a production loss of some 30 000 t in the fourth quarter, including making allowances for ramp-up as the plant comes back on line. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Syrah is now expected to produce between 30 000 t and 35 000 t of graphite, with the full year production guidance standing at between 101 000 t and 106 000 t. The overall sales impact of the fire will be minimised through the drawdown of existing inventory, the company said.
