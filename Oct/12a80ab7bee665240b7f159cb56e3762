West African gold producer Avesoro Resources produced 47 177 oz of gold from its New Liberty mine, in Liberia, and its Youga gold mine, in Burkina Faso, in the quarter ended September 30, bringing year-to-date gold production to 175 496 oz. Ore mining rates increased at both New Liberty and Youga during the third quarter, compared with the previous quarter. Total material moved was also consistent with the previous quarter, notwithstanding the third quarter being the peak of the wet season in both Burkina Faso and Liberia. “I am pleased that the company has been able to maintain total material movement throughout the peak of the wet seasons in both Liberia and Burkina Faso, with Youga, in particular, experiencing three times more rain this year than during the same period in 2017,” Avesoro CEO Serhan Umurhan commented on Tuesday. Moving into the fourth quarter, the company expects total material movement to increase, with the company maintaining its full-year production guidance at 220 000 oz to 240 000 oz.
