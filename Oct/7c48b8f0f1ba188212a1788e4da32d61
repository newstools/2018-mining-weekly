Mongolia-focused Xandu Mines will list on the TSX on Thursday, as part of the company’s efforts to develop a broader awareness of its porphyry copper/gold discovery in Mongolia’s south Gobi. “The listing will further build the profile of the company and understanding of its potential among North American investors. Our TSX listing is timely given the substantial amount of activity planned, including the resource upgrade and preliminary economic assessment on our Kharmagtai project, which is due in the fourth quarter,” said MD and CEO Andrew Stewart. Xanadu is already listed on the ASX.
