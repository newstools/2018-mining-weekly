PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Minerals sands miner Base Resources has reported a 35% increase in mined tonnes during the three months to September, following the successful implementation of the Kwale Phase 2 mine optimisation project, at its operation in Kenya. The Kwale project produced a record 25 125 t of rutile and 9 683 t of zircon during the quarter, as well as 118 265 t of ilmenite. This was compared with the 24 451 t of rutile, 9 286 t of zircon and 114 773 t of ilmenite produced in the June quarter. The Phase 2 project will increase the mining rate at Kwale from 1 800 t/h to 2 400 t/h, increasing average full-year rutile production from 68 000 t/y to 93 000 t/y, ilmenite production from 307 000 t/y to 414 000 t/y and zircon production from 25 000 t/y to 34 000 t/y.

Base is investing $32.6-million in the expansion project. Base on Thursday reported that ilmenite sales for the three months to September reached 107 632 t, which was in line with the 107 170 t sold in the previous quarter, while rutile sales were down from 25 635 t to 23 580 t, and zircon sales were down from 9 007 t to 8 507 t. Meanwhile, Base told shareholders that engineering work, procurement, clearing and earthworks for the planned transition of mining from the Central Dune to the Southern Dune, in July next year, continued during the quarter under review, with orders placed for all major items and equipment. The move is expected to cost Base some $12.3-million, and the costs will be incurred in the 2019 financial year. Looking ahead, Base expected rutile production for the full 2019 to reach between 88 000 t and 93 000 t, while ilmenite production was expected to be between 420 000 t and 450 000 t, and zircon production between 32 000 t and 37 000 t.
