Harte Gold has officially opened Ontario’s first gold in ten years, with a grand opening and ribbon cutting ceremony, attended by Premier Doug Ford, for the Sugar Zone gold mine. Ford said in a statement that the opening of the mine signalled that Ontario was open for business. “It shows that this government is committed to improving the conditions for businesses, so they can thrive.” The mine in northern Ontario contains an indicated mineral resource of 2.6-million tonnes, grading 8.52 g/t gold for 714 200 oz contained gold and an inferred mineral resource of 3.59-million tonnes, grading 6.59 g/t for 760 800 oz contained gold. Harte Gold is conducting a 100 000 m drill programme on near mine and exploration targets and said it would announce an updated resource estimate in the first quarter of next year.
