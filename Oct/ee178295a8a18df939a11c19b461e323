A soil sampling programme has started at a copper/cobalt licence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) owned by Aim-listed natural resources development company Red Rock Resources. The licence was recently acquired from a private seller. This soil sampling programme will take place on grids of 100 m by 100 m and 100 m by 200 m in different parts of the licence. The method used is termite mound sampling, which has been found to be an effective tool for soil sampling in the DRC. The programme seeks to test the hypothesis that copper and cobalt mineralisation is present and has been concentrated by the local geological structures. Red Rock’s local contractor Minex Consulting has mobilised a 14-man team to the site and expects to complete a 17-day programme before the rainy season begins. “Our work in the Congo has exposed us to a number of opportunities, at the time when setbacks in the market and in cobalt and copper prices, combined with the uncertainties related to the elections, had created a market more favourable to buyers than for some time. The low entry cost of this opportunity, and its mineral potential, made it worth taking,” says Red Rock chairperson Andrew Bell.
