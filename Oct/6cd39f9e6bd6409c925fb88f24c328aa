The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has called for coal to be retained far more strongly in the country’s energy mix. In its submission on the draft Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 2018, the NUM Western Cape said it was concerned that coal’s share in the energy mix was set to be reduced. “As the NUM, we submit that the reduction of coal in the mix should be reversed. South Africa still has huge coal reserves. We can’t just stop using this strategic resource. What we suggest is that we venture into clean coal technology.” The NUM Western Cape said the proposed energy mix in the draft IRP 2018 "does not, in any way, provide a reliable and stable base load". The union said that even if South Africa scaled back on coal locally, it would continue to be exported. “The mining of coal is not going to stop. Coal will be mined and exported to other countries like China [that are] going to burn the coal in the very same atmosphere we are trying to save.” The union said research had shown that water use for the generation of electricity could be reduced through the adoption of new coal technology. Reducing water use should not be used as one of the reasons for phasing out coal. “Medupi and Kusile will use less water than Grootvlei and Komati,” said the NUM.
