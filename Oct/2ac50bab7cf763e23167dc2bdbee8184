Canadian potash junior Ecanto Potash on Friday announced the departure of Richard Lively from the company – only three months after he was appointed COO. The company did not provide a reason for Lively’s departure, but stated that it would continue its efforts to reduce projected capital expenditure costs at its Muskowekwan project, in Saskatchewan. When Ecanto announced Lively's appointment as COO in July, it stated that it would initialise an engineering plan under his guidance, with the aim of moving the project towards construction stage.
