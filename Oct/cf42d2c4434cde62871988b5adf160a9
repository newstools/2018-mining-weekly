Alphamin Resources has satisfied the conditions required to draw down an additional $25-million under a previously announced credit facility of up to $80-million. The drawdown will take the total amount drawn under the credit facility to $60-million. The remaining $20-million is expected to be drawn in December. The funds will be applied towards the development of the Bisie tin project, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The mine is expected to start production in the first half of 2019 and will produce about 9 642 t/y of tin.
