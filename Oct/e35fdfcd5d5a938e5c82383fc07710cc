PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Rare earths miner Northern Minerals has produced its first rare earth carbonate at its Browns Range pilot plant, in Western Australia. The production of the first final product followed the start of plant commissioning in June this year. “It is yet another significant milestone for Northern Minerals and the Browns Range project. This is the first production of rare earths carbonate from xenotime ore outside of China and represents a new global source of product,” said Northern Minerals MD and CEO George Bauk. “Commissioning is progressing well and we look forward to the next milestone being the first shipment of product to our customers.” The pilot plant is expected to produce 573 000 kg of mixed heavy rare earth carbonate containing terbium and dysprosium as revenue products, over a three-year period.
