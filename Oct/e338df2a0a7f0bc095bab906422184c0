Russian diamond miner Alrosa subsidiary AlmazyAnabara has extracted a large 28.59-ct rough diamond of deep greenish-yellow hue – its largest yellow rough diamond for the year. The diamond was discovered at Ebelyakh placer deposit in July. "The extracted stone is our new unique discovery. Fancy colours are very rare in nature. This stone is also unique, because nature seemed to have prepared it for cutting and in advance gave it a pear-like shape. United Selling Organization of Alrosa and the company's cutting division have yet to study the diamond and decide whether to auction it as a rough or to cut it into polished diamond,” United Selling Organisation director Evgeny Agureev said on Monday. AlmazyAnabara is traditionally the leader in the number of fancy-coloured stones. In 2017, AlmazyAnabaraalso extracted a unique 27.85-ct pure pink diamond – the largest pink stone in the group’s history, and a large 34.17-ct vivid yellow diamond. Alrosa plans to focus its cutting division on the processing of large and coloured diamonds and the subsequent sales. The group produces at least 7 000 ct/y of coloured diamonds.
