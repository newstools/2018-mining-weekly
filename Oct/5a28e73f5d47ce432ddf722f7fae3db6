Vancouver-based Strongbow Exploration has appointed Osisko Mining VP for new business development, Don Njegovan, to its board of directors to replace John Burzynski, who stepped down on Friday. Burzynski will join the company’s technical advisory committee. With more than 20 years of experience in the mining industry, Njegovan brings a “wealth of mining and banking experience” to the board, the company noted in a statement. Njegovan holds a BSc degree in Mining Engineering from Michigan Technological University and a BA from the University of Manitoba. Strongbow is advancing the South Crofty underground project near Pool, in Cornwall, in the UK.
