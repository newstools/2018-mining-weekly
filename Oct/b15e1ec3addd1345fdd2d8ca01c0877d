PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Base metals miner New Century Resources has loaded the first zinc concentrate from its Century mine, in Queensland, for export. The first shipment will consist of 10 000 t of zinc concentrate, and will be delivered to smelters in China. “This milestone represents an incredible achievement by the entire New Century team. To start shipping concentrate just 15 months after listing is a testament to the strong dedication and culture within the company,” said New Century MD Patrick Walta. The company said on Monday that the first shipment of 10 000 t had allowed the company to complete another forward sale of 10 000 to zinc concentrate, generating a further A$15.3-million in revenue.
