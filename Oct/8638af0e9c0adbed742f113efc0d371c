Aim-listed Central Asia Metals (CAML) has had a good third quarter and is on track to meet its production guidance for the year, the miner reported on Thursday. In the third quarter, the base metals firm produced 3 938 t of copper from its Kounrad operation, in Kazakhstan, and 5 472 t of copper in concentrate and 7 602 t of lead in concentrate from the Sasa mine, in Macedonia. In the first nine months of the year, CAML produced 10 686 t of copper, 16 762 t of zinc and 21 988 t of lead. “We have experienced a good quarter at both of our operations, with copper cathode output at Kounrad up by 2.5% when compared to the third quarter of 2017, and improved zinc recoveries at Sasa. Our production figures confirm that we are on track to achieve 2018 guidance for all three of our metal products,” said CEO Nigel Robinson. The full-year guidance is copper output of between 13 000 t and 14 000 t, zinc in concentrate output of 21 000 t to 23 000 t and lead in concentrate production of 28 000 t to 30 000 t.
