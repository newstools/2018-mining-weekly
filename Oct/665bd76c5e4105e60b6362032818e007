Aim-listed African Battery Metals (ABM) has started geological work on its recently acquired 380 km2 Lizetta II nickel/cobalt/chrome exploration project, in Côte d’Ivoire. ABM commissioned a site visit by a technical team to prepare for a structured field exploration programme, the results of which will supplement the 2017 Watts Griffis McOuat independent consultancy results. The previous work confirmed the occurrence of up to 0.25% cobalt, 0.87% nickel and more than 1% chrome in surface anomalies. A supplementary surface sampling programme is planned to explore the extension of the mineralisation anomaly to the south-south-east within the project, as well as to follow up on unexplored areas, with the aim of identifying areas potentially suitable for reverse circulation drilling. ABM CEO Roger Murphy commented that planning of field activities was progressing well and that it marked the next stage in development of the company’s current asset base, which includes cobalt and nickel projects in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
