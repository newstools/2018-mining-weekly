Australian Atlas Iron on Monday named Sanjiv Manchanda as chief executive in a board overhaul, replacing Cliff Lawrenson amid an acquisition by billionaire Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting. Manchanda has earlier served as Head of Project Development for Hancock Prospecting. Atlas also appointed Spiro Pappas as its Chairman. The changes in the board come as Hancock Prospecting's unit Redstone Corporation is in the process of acquiring the junior miner, having secured more than 90% of Atlas shares. Atlas had endorsed a A$390-million ($277.29-million) buyout from Hancock in June.
