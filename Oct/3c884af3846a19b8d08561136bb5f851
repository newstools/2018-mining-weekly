PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium miner Altura Mining has shipped its first cargo of spodumene concentrate from Port Hedland to its offtake partner in China. The company on Tuesday said that some 5 000 t of spodumene concentrate was loaded onto the vessel MV Clipper Tenacious, which was shared with two other exporters. “We are now producing and exporting lithium concentrate that will become part of the lithium-ion battery revolution,” said Altura Mining MD James Brown. “A little bit of the Pilbara will now be found in the car, mobile phones and static storage batteries of the future.” Altura in July produced its first spodumene from the mine, which will produce some 220 000 t/y of 6% lithium concentrate when in full production. Spodumene concentrate from the mine will be stockpiled in a purpose-built storage facility in Port Hedland, which has a capacity of 40 000 t, with Altura presently having the rights to 30 000 t. The company is currently considering plans to double the production of the Pilgangoora operation to 440 000 t/y to tap into the global demand for electric vehicle and static storage batteries.
