Aim-listed Edenville Energy has signed an offtake deal to supply an industrial customer in East Africa with 300 t a month to 500 t a month of coal for two years. Edenville has been working with the customer throughout this year to create a product specifically suited to the customer's operations and has been supplying test batches of coal. “After several months refining and testing our product, we are pleased to move forward with this customer on a formal supply contract basis. The customer is part of a global group supplying products to various industries worldwide. We will continue to work with the customer to ensure its needs are met.  We are also examining ways Edenville can further assist this group in mining related tasks,” Edenville CEO Rufus Short commented on Monday. Edenville operates the Rukwa coal mine in Tanzania.
