Canadian explorer Euro Manganese (EMN) has listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, in response to growing interest from European investors. The Canadian company, which owns the Chvaletice manganese project in the Czech Republic, also appointed Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Wertpapieranalyse as its investor relations adviser in Europe. Concurrently, due to the significant holdings in EMN by Australian investors and its listing on the ASX, the company has appointed NWR Communications as its investor relations adviser in Australia. EMN is listed on the TSX-V. The Chvaletice project entails re-processing a significant manganese deposit hosted in historic mine tailings. The company's goal is to supply ultrahigh-purity manganese products to the lithium-ion battery industry and to the specialty steel and aluminum alloys industries.
