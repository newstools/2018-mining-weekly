Zinc miner Titan Mining has appointed three new board members, all of whom served on the board of Arizona Mining, which was taken over by South32 in a $1.3bn deal. The TSX-listed company, which owns the Empire State Mine (ESM) in New York state, appointed former speaker John Boehner, former Arizona Mining CEO James Gowans and investment banker William Mulrow. “We welcome the addition of John, James and William to the board. These distinguished directors will enhance Titan’s profile in the US and bring a wealth of mining and financial expertise to the board as they did for Arizona Mining,” Titan executive chairperson Richard Warke said on Tuesday. Boehner, a member of the Republican party, served as the fifty-third Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015. Following his career in government service, Boehner joined Squire Patton Boggs, a global law and public policy firm. Gowans has more than 30 years' experience in mineral exploration, feasibility studies, construction and operations, including at the Red Dog and Polaris mines. He was formerly president and CEO of Arizona Mining, and co-president, executive VP and COO of Barrick Gold. Prior roles include MD of Debswana Diamond Company and president and CEO of De Beers Canada. Mulrow is a senior advisor at alternative asset manager, the Blackstone Group. Previously, he was director of Global Capital Markets at Citigroup, MD of Paladin Capital and senior VP at Gabelli Asset Management. Titan is an Augusta Group company, which produces zinc concentrate at its 100%-owned ESM. ESM is a group of zinc mines which started production in the early 1900s.
