US lawyer James Cameron and UrAmerica chairperson Damien Hackett have joined the board of Russian gold miner Petropavlovsk as independent nonexecutive directors with immediate effect. Cameron is well known in business circles in California as a successful entrepreneur and investor and has had wide experience in Russia over the past quarter-century, including as an adviser to gold-mining projects in the Far East of the country. Hackett has been involved in the mining sector since 1975 as a geologist, analyst and investment adviser, and has known Petropavlovsk well over the past 15 years. “When the present directors were elected on June 29, we declared our intention to strengthen the board through the appointment of additional independent nonexecutive directors as part of our commitment to corporate governance,” said Petropavlovsk nonexecutive chairperson Roderic Lynne.
