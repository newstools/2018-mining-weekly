Namibian base metals miner Weatherly International has restarted the process of reviewing its strategic options, including the possible sale of some of its subsidiaries or assets. The process will be led by Numis Securities and Treadstone Resource Partners. This follows after the company, in June, appointed Simon Kirkhope and Andrew Johnson of FTI Consulting as administrators. Since then, material improvements have been made to dewatering capabilities at Weatherlyâ€™s Tschudi openpit mine, which had experienced significant water ingress, leading to uncertainty as to when mining operations could restart. Weatherly on Monday said parties interested in potentially acquiring any of its subsidiaries or assets should contact Numis or Treadstone. In addition to the Tschudi copper mine, in Tsumeb, Weatherly also owns the Central Operations, which includes three underground mines and an 800 000 t/y copper concentrator, as well as the Berg Aukas lead/zinc/vanadium project, near Tsumeb. The Central Operations were put on care and maintenance in late 2015.
