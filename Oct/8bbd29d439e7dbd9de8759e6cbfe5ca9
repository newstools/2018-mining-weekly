In January-September GEO production was 61 761 oz, up 28% year-on-year. Gold is produced at Gedabek and other Azeri mines under a production venture in which Anglo Asian holds 51% and the state the remainder.

It eventually plans to develop seven mines in western Azerbaijan, including Gedabek, with estimated gold reserves of 430 t in total. The company started a significant exploration programme at the end of 2016 after making a new gold discovery at Ugur, 3 km from its Gedabek processing facilities.
