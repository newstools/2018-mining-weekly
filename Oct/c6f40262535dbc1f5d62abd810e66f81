PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Troy Resources has reported a slight drop in gold production during the three months to September, compared with the previous quarter. During the three months under review, Troy produced 18 991 oz of gold from its Karouni operation, in Guyana, compared with the 19 510 oz produced in the June quarter. Troy said on Friday that production in the September quarter exceeded the budget, despite a slow start in the month of July, which was below budget owing to mill maintenance which reduced throughput. “Despite a slow start to the quarter and the year, the operational team has put together another excellent quarter, which is again in excess of budget,” said Troy MD Ken Nilsson.
