Canadian junior Euro Manganese (EMM) has secured the right to a parcel of industrial zoned land adjacent to the Chvaletice manganese tailings project, where the company plans to build its high-purity manganese processing facility. The 19.94 ha land will be acquired through EP Chvaletice (EPCS), a small Czech steel fabrication firm. The property contains numerous buildings, including office, warehousing and other industrial structures, several of which are leased to short-term tenants. EMM will acquire EPCS for about C$7.32-million and has said it will retrain and transition as many as possible EPCS employees into the proposed Chvaletice manganese project. “By securing the right to acquire this strategic parcel of land, together with the adjacent property we acquired in 2017, Euro Manganese has taken a significant step towards de-risking the Chvaletice manganese project,” commented EMM president and CEO Marco Romero. The proposed project entails re-processing a manganese deposit hosted in historic mine tailings, strategically-located in the Czech Republic. EMM is completing a preliminary economic assessment, which it intends to present in the coming months. The project has a preliminary mining permit, the right to initiate the environmental assessment phase.
