Edenville Energy has signed a “significant” two-year contract with an industrial group operating in East Africa for the supply of a specialised coal product. The contract is for the supply of 3 500 t a month of coal, with an option for the customer to increase this to up to 6 000 t a month. Edenville has been working with this customer for some time to create a product specifically suited to the customer’s operations and has been supplying test batches of coal. “I am very pleased we have formalised this relationship and have secured Edenville's largest single coal contract to date,” commented Edenville CEO Rufus Short. Owing to this contract, the company now boasts in excess of 8 000 t a month in regular orders.
