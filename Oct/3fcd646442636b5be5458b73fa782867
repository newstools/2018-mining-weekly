PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Rare earths miner Lynas was still seeking clarity from the Malaysian government over the details of a reported review committee established to review the company’s operations in that country. Lynas on Tuesday said that local media outlets in Malaysia had announced the members of the review panel, which included representatives from a number of universities, as well as the former director of the Department of Environment’s Air and Hazardous Substances Division. Long-time opponents of Lynas, Fuziah Salleh and Wong Tack were not listed among the committee members, despite previous reports that they would be on the committee. Local media also reported that the committee has been given six weeks in which to conduct their review, with the objective of evaluating the Lynas Advanced Material Plant’s operations, including safety, health and environment aspects, as well as residue storage.
