PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Fertoz has inked a marketing agreement over 100 000 t of additional phosphate ore resource close to its operations in Montana. Fertoz said on Wednesday that the stockpiled material provided sufficient supply to meet the company’s sales target of between 30 000 t and 50 000 t of fertilizer products in the 2019 financial year, and 100 000 t in 2020. “Although we have made good progress recently in relation to permitting our Alberta leases for a bulk sample, we wanted to ensure we had sufficient ore available to make our 2019 fertiliser sales target,” said Fertoz executive chairperson Patrick Avery. “After assessing various small deposits and stockpiles across North America, we settled on this particular stockpile due to its proximity to our existing operations, its similarly high quality, and its ability to be processed into the various blends and sizes that our customers demand. We plan to move over 5 000 t of this ore to Butte, Montana, over the coming weeks to process it, ready for deliveries in 2019.”
