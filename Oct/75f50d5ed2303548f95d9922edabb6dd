PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ A definitive feasibility study (DFS) into the Ardmore phosphate rock project, in Queensland, has confirmed that the project could deliver 800 000 t/y of phosphate rock concentrate over a minimum ten-year mine life. ASX-listed Centrex Metals this week reported that the project would require a capital investment of A$77-million, while life-of-mine operating costs, excluding royalties, have been estimated at A$149/t. The expected capital cost was higher than the January scoping study projections of between A$55-million to A$61-million, which was based on a 776 000 t/y phosphate rock output. The DFS estimated a pre-tax net present value of A$172-million and an internal rate of return of 40%. Centrex said on Tuesday that the initial start-up plant was currently being fabricated, with first operations scheduled to start in mid-2019, providing some 30 000 t of concentrate to several potential long-term offtake customers. The start-up plant is readily upgradable to achieve full-scale production, which Centrex said represented a major step in technically and commercially de-risking the project. Centrex has already inked a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Indian major Gujarat State Fertilizer & Chemical for 40% of the offtake from the project, with the parties currently negotiating a binding agreement. Project financing is targeted for completion in the second half of 2019 from a mix of equity and debt instruments, with full scale production targeted at the start of 2021.
