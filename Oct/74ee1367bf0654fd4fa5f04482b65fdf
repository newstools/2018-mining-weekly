Jorge Aceituno has resigned as COO and executive director of Orosur Mining to accept a position closer to his family in Chile, the TSX- and Aim-listed junior announced on Friday. Orosur, which recently closed down its San Gregorio mine in Uruguay, said that its renewed focus on the Anza project, in Colombia, with backing from major Newmont Mining, meant that the opportunity for Aceituno came at an opportune time. “The company is grateful for Mr. Aceituno’s contributions and years of service and wishes him the best of luck in his future endeavours,” it stated. The resignation is with immediate effect and his duties are being reassigned to existing managers in the company. Last month, Newmont and Orosur announced an exploration option agreement in terms of which the major would earn into the 207.5 ha Anza gold project. Newmont has also invested $2-million, through a private placement, in the cash-strapped junior, giving it a 19.9% stake in Orosur.
