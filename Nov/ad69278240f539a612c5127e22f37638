Dual-listed Alacer Gold has processed the first sulphide ore through its newly constructed sulphide plant at the Çöpler mine, with the first autoclave coming on line over the weekend and now operating as designed. Announcing the achievement on Tuesday, CEO Rod Antal hailed the successful processing of sulphide ore as a “monumental milestone” for Alacer. “We are very proud of our team who have successfully constructed and delivered the plant well under budget - an exceptional outcome given the significance of the undertaking. We can now confidently say the Çöpler mine will deliver tremendous value for many years to come,” he said. The new plant in September started processing oxide ore and will achieve commercial production in early 2019, with ramp-up to full nameplate capacity of 1.9-million tonnes a year expected by the end of 2019. The sulphide plant will add 20 years of production to Çöpler, which has been operating since 2010 as a heap leach operation processing oxide ore.
