National Treasury has released a bombshell report of more than 600 pages detailing the extent of rot at Transnet and Eskom over the last six years â€“ and says Malusi Gigaba compromised the procurement process of controversial new Chinese locomotives. The report, compiled after a forensic investigation by Fundudzi Forensic Investigation Services, found widespread irregularities, improper and illegal payments and flouting of good governance laws. The investigation specifically looked at the deals between Eskom and coal producer Tegeta, the contracts between Regiments Capital and Trillian Advisory Services with both Eskom and Transnet as well as management consultant McKinsey. Tegeta, Regiments and Trillian are all Gupta connected or owned. The report also looked at the acquisition by Transnet of new Chinese locomotives from which the Gupta-linked companies also benefited. The report states: "Minister Gigaba compromised the procurement process by signing the LSA between Transnet and CSR as a witness." Other findings include: The investigators urge Treasury to act on its investigations in order to address the underlying issues at Transnet and Eskom and to not only treat the "symptoms" of governance shortcomings.
