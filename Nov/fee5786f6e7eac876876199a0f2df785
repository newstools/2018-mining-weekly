Difficult market conditions in the junior resources sector have opened up multiple prospects for London-listed ECR Minerals, which on Tuesday confirmed that it was considering a number of gold and potentially energy minerals opportunities. The company has already announced an option agreement to acquire the Iceberg project, in Western Australia, and said that it had been presented with a number of additional gold-focused opportunities, which it could acquire at a “low-cost entry level”. “The backdrop of difficult conditions in the junior resource sector has simply opened up multiple opportunities and although we would all like to see stronger market conditions generally, ECR is taking full advantage of the wide breadth of projects available,” said CEO Craig Brown. In terms of a potential energy metals and minerals business, the company is undertaking due diligence on a number of projects. ECR already owns gold assets in Australia, Argentina and the Philippines.
