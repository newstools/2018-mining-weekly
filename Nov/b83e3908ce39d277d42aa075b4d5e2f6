The De Beers Group Designers Initiative is inviting jewellery designers to participate in the 2018/19 Shining Light Awards, which will, for the first time, be open to Canadian participants. The latest edition of this biannual jewellery design competition, which has existed for over 22 years in South Africa and for more than ten years in Botswana and Namibia, will be held under the theme of heroines and heritage and will include elements that speak to women and that evoke national pride, as well as symbols of strength, heritage, wisdom and beauty. “The Shining Light Awards have proven to be a valuable design platform to showcase talent and open opportunities for young people within the diamond sector and international markets. This is in line with De Beers Group's objectives on beneficiation through skills development of the youth,” says De Beers Group executive VP and Forevermark CEO Stephen Lussier. Winners of the Shining Light Awards will participate in a 12-month apprenticeship programme in Milan, Italy, and runners-up will secure a three-month internship programme at Forevermark or a design programme at a local design school. “Over the years, we have seen how the Shining Light Awards have presented students with a great opportunity to develop their skills in jewellery manufacturing. We are looking forward to seeing the journey they take in interpreting the theme and bringing it to life. It is most gratifying that, as a result of this competition, we will now see winners enrolled through the Forevermark Design School in Milan, signifying the growth of the programme since inception” says Forevermark head of brand strategy and innovation Constantino Papadimitriou. Entries will close on January 31, 2019.
