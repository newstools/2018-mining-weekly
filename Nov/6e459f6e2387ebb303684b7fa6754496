PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed junior Artemis Resources has secured some A$5.4-million in funding from a UK-based institutional investor to fund exploration in the Patersons Range, in Western Australia. “This new funding allows Artemis to start exploration at Armada and finalise the next resource upgrade and preliminary metallurgical results from our Carlow Castle gold/copper/cobalt project near Karratha, while we await key approvals from the Western Australian government for our Radio Hill tailings facility,” said Artemis executive chairperson David Lenigas. “We believe this funding package is important to the company, as it keeps us well funded at a time we want to be advancing our projects on multiple fronts and don’t want to be slowed by global markets not generally favourable to junior resource companies.” The Armada prospect lies within a granted exploration licence covering some 600 km2 and adjoins the Havieron gold/copper discovery owned by Greatland Gold.
