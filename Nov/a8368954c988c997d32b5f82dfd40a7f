PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Graphite developer Triton Minerals has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China’s largest building materials group to develop the Ancuabe graphite project, in Mozambique. Under the terms of the MoU, Suzhou Sinoma Design and Research Institute of Non-metallic Minerals Industry Co, has expressed interest in participating in debt financing for the Ancuabe project, and in providing technical consulting services in relation to graphite process technology, producing line equipment, construction and commissioning, as well as product quality control. “Suzhou have shown strong interest in Ancuabe, and have requested involvement in many aspects of the project,” said Triton MD Peter Canterbury. “The agreement of the MoU provides further validation of its status as a world-class graphite project.” Canterbury said that the partnership was expected to greatly benefit Triton in the construction and commissioning of Ancuabe. A definitive feasibility study on the Ancuabe project estimated that it would require preproduction capital of $99.4-million to build a mine that is capable of producing about 60 000 t/y of graphite concentrate. The project is expected to produce its first graphite in the second half of 2019.
