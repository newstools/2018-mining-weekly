Gold miner Pan African Resources has finalised the exploration drilling programme on the Royal Sheba project, in Barberton, Mpumalanga, and declared a mineral resource estimate of 800 000 oz, out of an 8.97-million-tonne reserve, grading 2.62 g/t gold. The consultancy that signed off on the mineral resource estimate, SRK Consulting, said about 370 000 oz was near surface and conducive to openpit mining, out of a total 5.80-million-tonne reserve grading 1.96 g/t gold. The Royal Sheba drilling programme, which totalled 4 311 m of drilling across three phases, confirmed robust mineralisation extending from the surface along a 900 m strike and 150 m downdip of the Royal Sheba orebody. The underground mineral resource is delineated at 390 000 oz, out of a 3.12-million-tonne reserve, grading 3.87 g/t gold. Meanwhile, consultancy DRA Global is progressing a definitive feasibility study on the project, which is expected to be completed in February 2019. Pan African has started an extended drilling programme at its Barberton Minesâ€™ mining right at New Consort Mines, targeting the main maiden reef orebody, as a potential satellite deposit for the Royal Sheba project. The drilling is targeting a resource of between 200 000 oz and 300 000 oz of gold grading between 2 g/t and 4 g/t gold.
