Australia-headquartered mining explorer and developer European Lithium started trading on the NEX Exchange Growth Market (NEX) in London on Wednesday. The listing provides the company, which is developing the Wolfsberg lithium project in Austria, increased exposure and access to European investors. Chairperson Tony Sage commented in a statement that joining the NEX marked a significant milestone in the company’s journey to becoming Europe’s local lithium supplier. “We believe this move creates an important opportunity for European investors, giving them greater access to the lithium sector amidst the global transition to electric vehicles.” European Lithium’s primary listing is on the ASX and it is also listed in Frankfurt and Vienna. The Wolfsberg project is expected to deliver some 620 000 t/y run-of-mine production over a 12-year period, with the project’s prefeasibility study estimating an average production of 55 400 t/y of spodumene concentrate, with an average of 114 000 t of feldspar and 71 000 t of quartz as by-products. The company is in the process of completing a definitive feasibility study.
