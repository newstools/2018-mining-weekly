Diversified miner African Rainbow Minerals' (ARM's) shares started trading on the A2X on Thursday.
 
ARM, which will retain its primary listing on the JSE, is the first mining company to list on the A2X. “As A2X gains greater traction, more companies are seeing the benefits that a secondary listing can bring to their shareholders. Not only does it provide an alternative venue on which to transact but the low fee structure drives significant savings for the end investor as it creates a better quality market by narrowing spread and attracting new liquidity,” A2X CEO Kevin Brady said in a release issued on Thursday.
