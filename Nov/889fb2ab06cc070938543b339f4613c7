Aim- and AltX-listed Jubilee Metals' Hernic Platinum project reached a new production milestone in October, producing 2 500 oz of platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium, or 6E platinum-group metals (PGMs). "It is very gratifying to see our Hernic project deliver and exceed even on its stretched design targets so early in the project's life cycle. This strong performance continues to favour Jubilee to benefit from the strong palladium and rhodium prices which forms part of the PGM basket produced at Hernic," Jubilee CEO Leon Coetzer said on Monday. He added that the current quarter was also an "exciting" period for Jubilee, with its Dilokong Fine Chrome and its PlatCro PGM projects to be commissioned soon.
