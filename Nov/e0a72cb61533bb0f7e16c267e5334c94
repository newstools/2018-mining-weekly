JSE-listed gold miner Gold Fields says members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) continued with strike action at the miner’s South Deep operation, in Johannesburg, on Sunday, in reaction to planned retrenchments at the mine. This despite the fact that the company had obtained a court interdict against the strike on Saturday. Gold Fields said production at the mine had been stopped and only essential services teams were working at the mine. Last week, Gold Fields sent retrenchment letters to about 1 100 employees – 30% of the mine’s workforce. Additionally, the mine has reduced the number of contractors by about 420 people. Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland said South Deep was not in a position to reverse the decision and that the retrenchment process was being undertaken in line with legislation and collective agreements. Before the protest, the mine was losing an average of R3-million a day.
