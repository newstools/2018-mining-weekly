PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mineral sands miner Iluka on Wednesday reported a second strike at its Sierra Leone operations in as many months, but said that it was hopeful of restarting mining within the next few days, after the country’s President intervened to find a solution. President Julius Maada Bio has established a taskforce to help resolve the issues between Iluka and the United Mineworker’s Union. The government has urged all mineworkers to respect the rule of law and their fellow workers, and has urged parties involved to positively engage, consult and dialogue with one another. The government has noted that discipline in all mining operations was paramount to ensure the safe and efficient production of minerals, to the benefit of Sierra Leone. Iluka told shareholders on Wednesday that the impact on rutile production and sales commitments would be dependent on the time required to return to full operation, but was likely to be at the lower end of the previous guidance range of between 125 000 t and 130 000 t of rutile. The miner at the end of October restarted mining operations at its Sierra Rutile project, after a first round of illegal strike action.
