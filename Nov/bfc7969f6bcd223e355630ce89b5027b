The listing allows us to introduce MOD Resources to European and UK investors as we look to develop into a substantial copper producer,” said MOD MD Julian Hanna. “The LSE has a strong track record as a leading destination for companies with African mining assets, making it a natural dual listing destination for a company like ours with an exciting copper portfolio in Botswana’s Kalahari copper belt.” MOD is currently undertaking a feasibility study on its T3 copper project, in Botswana, which is due for completion in the first quarter of 2019.
