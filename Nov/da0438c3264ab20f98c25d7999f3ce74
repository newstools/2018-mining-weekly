JSE- and NYSE-listed Sibanye-Stillwater on Wednesday reported that acts of violence continued to be experienced at its South African gold operations, where a strike by Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) members was under way. “The situation at the Beatrix and Driefontein operations, in particular, remains tense, with striking workers causing damage to company property and restricting access to the company’s operating mine sites,” Sibanye alleged. “Sibanye respects the right of AMCU members to strike and upholds the right of employees who wish to work to do so. By their unlawful actions, striking employees are preventing other employees from exercising their right to work, thereby inflicting financial hardship on employees who do not wish to strike,” it noted. The gold miner added that the acts of violence were in contravention of the interdict granted to Sibanye by the Labour Court on November 22. AMCU members embarked on the strike action on November 21, after wage negotiations between Sibanye and the union could not be concluded. Sibanye had reached a wage agreement with other unions.
