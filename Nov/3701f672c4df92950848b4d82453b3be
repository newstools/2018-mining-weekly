PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold developer West African Resources has awarded an underground mining contract worth $110-million at its Sanbrado gold project, in Burkina Faso. The five-year contract was awarded to mining services provider Byrnecut Burkina Faso, and follows a competitive tender process and extensive due diligence process, said West African MD Richard Hyde. “We are very pleased to award the underground mining contract to Byrnecut who have a long history providing underground mining services globally and have current operating experience in West Africa,” said Hyde. Portal establishment at M1 South is expected to start in March next year, and the underground development would access high-grade, free milling gold mineralisation directly beneath the proposed M1 South openpit mine.
