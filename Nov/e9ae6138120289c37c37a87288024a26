PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Edna Beryl gold mine, in the Northern Territory, is one step closer to starting after plans for a dewatering pipeline were approved, which will extend the life of the mine by allowing access to the deeper reaches of the deposit. The Northern Territory’s Primary Industry and Resource Minister Ken Vowles said that the latest approval meant four additional jobs during the construction of the pipeline, in addition to the jobs already created. “When our government approved Edna Beryl officially opening last year, six immediate operator jobs were created, with additional personnel such as surveyors, engineers, geologists and truck drivers employed at various stages throughout operation,” Vowles said. “The new pipeline will also mean the mine can grow and stay in production for longer, which could result in further jobs in the future.” Edna Beryl is one of many small mines in the Tennant Creek area and will potentially be the first of many new projects that go into development and production in the region. The Northern Territory government is hoping to develop Tennant Creek as a mining hub, and as part of the 2017 Budget, the Territory government announced a feasibility study into building a common user mine and processing facility in Tennant Creek. The new pipeline at Edna Beryl will follow the alignment of an original pipeline between Edna Beryl and the historic Northern Star Mine 6 km to the west, and will consist of 140 mm diameter poly-pipe.
