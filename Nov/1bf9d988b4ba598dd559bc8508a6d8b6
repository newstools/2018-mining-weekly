The newly commissioned Verkhne-Munskoe deposit, in western Yakutia, has yielded its first large diamond, Russian miner Alrosa reported on Wednesday, announcing the recovery of a 51.49 ct rough diamond. The transparent round-shaped octahedron crystal has an insignificant yellow hue and measures 23 mm by 22 mm by 15 mm. "It is the first rough diamond over 50 carats from Verkhnyaya Muna. We have just started mining here, so it is a very promising event evidencing of the good potential of the deposit,” said Alrosa director for the Udachny mining and processing division, Alexander Makhrachev. “Despite small inclusions and cracks, this stone is undoubtedly a gem-quality rough diamond that will bring to life one or several high-grade polished diamonds." The Verkhne-Munskoe deposit was officially commissioned at the end of October. The mine is expected to yield some 1.8-million carats a year of rough diamonds and its reserves are enough for mining for more than 20 years.
