Unionised employees at the Rosebel gold mine, in Suriname, have downed tools, triggering a force majeure to suspend operations at the mine. Canadian miner Iamgold said on Tuesday that the strike was in breach of a collective labour agreement (CLA) and that it would prepare legal action against the Rosebell Werknemers Organisatie. The new two-year CLA was finalised at Rosebel on September 14.
