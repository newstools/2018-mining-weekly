Canadian gold major Goldcorp has started producing gold from the tailings at the Peñasquito mine, in Mexico, as the $420-million pyrite leach project (PLP) has been completed and is now operating 24 hours a day. The PLP is expected to recover about 35% of the gold and 42% of the silver currently reporting to the tailings and is expected to add more than one-million ounces of gold and 45-million ounces of silver over the life-of-mine. The plant processes the existing plant tails, feeding a sequential flotation and leach circuit with precious metals recovered through a Merrill Crowe process, producing doré as the final product. Commissioning of the PLP started in the third quarter and commercial production is expected by the end of 2018 – two quarters ahead of plan. Goldcorp president and CEO David Garofalo said that the PLP was a major investment decision for the company. "We are very pleased with the results in completing the project both ahead of budget and schedule. We are already moving forward with a post investment review where we can take our lessons learned to continue to improve our framework and overall capital allocation strategy." The project, which was constructed by an all Mexican workforce, was completed 9% under budget.
