PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Celsius Resources is targeting a decision to mine at its Opuwo cobalt project, in Namibia, by the second half of 2020. The scoping study confirmed the potential for a large-scale, long-life operation, prompting Celsius to immediately start a prefeasibility study into the project, which is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2019. “The project scoping study has identified that a potentially large and long-life operation is possible at Opuwo. The study has identified two process routes that are technically viable to produce downstream products from the Opuwo mineral resource,” said Celsius MD Brendan Borg. The company on Wednesday said that a scoping study into the Opuwo project had confirmed that both openpit or underground mining techniques were feasible to exploit the mineral resource, and that metals could be extracted. “Preliminary studies of environmental, social, power, infrastructure and water supply considerations indicate no significant impediments to the development of the project. Further, a series of opportunities to enhance and more clearly define the economic value of the project have been identified, and will form a key part of the prefeasibility study,” said Borg. Opuwo currently hosts a mineral resource of 112.4-million tonnes, grading 0.11% cobalt, 0.41% copper and 0.43% zinc, containing some 126 100 t of cobalt.
