PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Graphite miner Syrah Resources has signed a binding term sales agreement with Qingdao Taida New Energy Technology for 20 000 t of natural graphite from the Balama project, in Mozambique. The agreement will start immediately, with the graphite to be delivered by the end of August next year. “This contract is another demonstration of Syrah’s Balama graphite product penetrating into China and the battery anode material market,” said Syrah MD and CEO Shaun Verner. “It is also pleasing to see the significant volume of spot sales translating into this type of quality longer term commitment as the sales book continues to evolve.” Verner said that Syrah was establishing Balama product as a baseload for battery anode materials and other industrial specialty applications. Balama is expected to produce between 101 000 t and 106 000 t of graphite in the full 2018.
