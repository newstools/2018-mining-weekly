ASX- and JSE-listed Orion Minerals has discovered a new copper/zinc-bearing massive sulphide body located near its flagship Prieska zinc/copper project, in the Areachap Belt, in the Northern Cape.
 
The discovery hole, OAXD002, was drilled at the Ayoba prospect, a satellite exploration target, and is both the first exploration hole drilled as part of the company’s near-mine exploration project and the first hole to test for new mineralisation surrounding the historical Prieska mine in more than three decades.
 
“The discovery at Ayoba is a very important breakthrough, which clearly demonstrates the potential for large satellite deposits to be discovered in close proximity to our advanced Prieska project.

“This important discovery demonstrates the huge potential to find additional deposits within a 5 km to 10 km radius of the proposed processing plant and mine infrastructure at Prieska, validating our exploration strategy, which is aimed at unlocking the value of this rich mineral province. It also demonstrates the advantage of using modern geophysical exploration techniques in such a well mineralised volcagenic massive sulphide terrain and is the deepest ‘blind deposit’ ever discovered in the Areachap,” Orion MD and CEO Errol Smart commented in a statement released on Wednesday.
