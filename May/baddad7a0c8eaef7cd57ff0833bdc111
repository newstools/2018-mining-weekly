PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Copper/gold miner Hillgrove Resources has resumed processing at its Kanmantoo operation, after a mechanical failure earlier in the month resulted in a temporary stoppage in production. Hillgrove undertook work to replace a failed bearing, with the company telling shareholders on Thursday that other planned preventative maintenance was brought forward, including a semi-autogenous grinding mill girth gear rotation. The company noted that undertaking this work would now reduce the quarterly scheduled shut down in July, by around three days.
