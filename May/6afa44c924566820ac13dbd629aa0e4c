PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Annual dredging has restarted at the Port of Karumba, as part of ASX-listed New Century Resources’ restart of the Century zinc mine, in Queensland. The 2018 dredging programme would see New Century invest A$6.8-million in the first dredging activities to be undertaken at Karumba since early 2016. The dredging programme will bring the channel back to 3.2 m depth, allowing transshipment of zinc concentrate to bulk cargo export vessels. Since the acquisition of the Century mine in March, the company has been working with Ports North to re-establish dredging operations to allow uninterrupted zinc concentrate transshipment operations. The company said on Monday that the dredging would also provide significant benefits to third-party users of the Karumba port area, allowing expansion of existing cattle exports and commercial fishing operations. The dredging programme will run for around 60 days and is scheduled for completion in July this year. The restarting of mining operations and zinc concentrate exports from the Century mine is expected in the third quarter of this year, with first production scheduled in August.
