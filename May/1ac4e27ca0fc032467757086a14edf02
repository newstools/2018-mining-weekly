BRASILIA â€“ Brazil's antitrust regulator Cade on Wednesday approved the sale of a Vale fertiliser unit to Yara International, sanctioning a deal that will allow the Norwegian giant to produce nitrogen-based fertilisers in Brazil. Six of Cade's seven board members voted to approve the $255-million transaction without demanding any asset sales or behavioural restrictions. One board member, Paula Farani, withheld from voting.
