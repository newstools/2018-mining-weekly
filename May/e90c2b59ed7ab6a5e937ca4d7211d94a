PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed Mineral Resources has confirmed that internal estimates have priced a lithium hydroxide plant at the Wodgina lithium project, in Western Australia.

The downstream lithium processing plant planned at Wodgina is currently the subject of a feasibility study. Mineral Resources at the start of May announced that it was looking for a joint venture partner to assist in the development of the Wodgina project, with the miner willing to sell up to a 49% stake in the asset, as part of an offtake and partnering process. The company is currently mining direct shipping ore at Wodgina while progressing its openpit pre-strip and constructing its spodumene concentrate plant with a capacity to produce 750 000 t/y of 6% spodumene concentrate.
