JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Uranium-focused Berkeley Energia has appointed corporate executive Sean Wade as COO to identify and lead strategic business development opportunities. Prior to joining Berkeley, Wade was director of international media and investor relations at Georgia’s largest bank, TBC. During his time at the bank, Wade played a leading role in the listing of the shares on the premium segment of the LSE and the inclusion of the company in the FTSE250 Index. Berkeley, which is currently listed on the Aim and ASX, has announced its intention to apply for admission of its ordinary shares to the main board of the LSE and to the Spanish Stock Exchanges (SSEs) of Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia. The directors consider that a listing on the LSE and the SSE is appropriate to provide the company with options for future growth regarding the Salamanca uranium project in Spain. "I am delighted to welcome Sean to Berkeley Energia. His broad experience in communications, branding and capital markets will be a vital addition to the team as we complete detailed reviews at the Salamanca mine to ensure that optimal capital and operating costs are achieved prior to full construction commencing,” Berkeley MD Paul Atherley comments.
