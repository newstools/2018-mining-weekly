VANCOUVER (miningweekly.com) – Canadian diamond producer Mountain Province Diamonds has appointed Stuart Brown as incoming president and CEO, effective from July 1, to replace interim president and CEO David Whittle, who took the helm following the immediate departure of former president and CEO Patrick Evans in June last year. Brown brings with him more than 25 years of experience in the diamond industry, where he has gained a wealth of experience across all aspects throughout the diamond pipeline from exploration, mine development and operations to the selling and marketing of diamonds. In 2006, Brown was appointed as the De Beers Group CFO, before taking on the role of CEO of Firestone Diamonds, a diamond producer in Lesotho.  Brown was responsible for securing the funding and building the team that delivered the successful construction and transition to production of Firestone's Liqhobong diamond mine. Brown holds a Bachelor of Accounting Science from the University of South Africa. Mountain Province Diamonds is a 49% participant with De Beers Canada in the Gahcho Kué diamond mine, consisting of a cluster of four diamondiferous kimberlites, three of which are being developed and mined under the initial 12 year mine plan.
