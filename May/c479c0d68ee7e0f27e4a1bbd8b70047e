PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland government has urged explorers to bid to explore the North West minerals province, before the latest exploration tender closes on May 24. The tender area covers more than 10 000 km2 of the state’s North West. “The North West minerals province is a world-class base metals region, and also has rich deposits of the rare minerals, including lithium, cobalt and graphite – that drive the latest technological innovations. “The increasing demand for these rare metals offers significant industry and employment opportunities for Queenslanders and helps position Queensland as a key supplier to the hi-tech industry globally,” said Mines Minister Anthony Lynham. Metals exploration in Queensland has increased 58% to A$47.3-million, investing in the industry’s future, the Minister said. “I say to resource companies, step up now, because this North-West tender could open the door to the next pipeline of mega projects.” Lynham said the state’s resources sector was maintaining its positive momentum from 2017 and continuing to create jobs. “Over the 12 months to March, our resources exports were worth A$56-billion, a 15% increase over the previous year. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows Queensland’s resources sector directly employed 59 000 people in February 2018 - 3 000 more than last February. “The coal and metals industry have been primarily responsible for this increase in jobs, which has come on the back of higher production from existing and new mines.” Lynham said that over the past six months, Queensland has seen higher global coal prices with several mines expanding production, including Realm Resources re-opening a second pit at its Foxleigh mine near Middlemount. “The Queensland metals industry is also experiencing a period of strong global prices, with base metal prices of copper, zinc and lead prices up significantly. “
