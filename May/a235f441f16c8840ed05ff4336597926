PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian government has signed an agreement with the government of Argentina to build a stronger mining and resource relationship between the two regions. Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston said the memorandum of understanding (MoU) will help develop a mutually rewarding partnership by sharing specialist knowledge, technical skills and regulatory know-how. It will also facilitate collaboration in a range of areas including geoscience systems, information technology, mining rehabilitation, occupational health and safety, royalties and taxation. “The agreement is a new and exciting way for the state to build relationships and open new markets for Western Australian goods and services,” Johnston said on Friday. He added that this new relationship would encourage investment between Western Australian and Argentine companies, and increase export opportunities for the state's mining, equipment, technology and services sector. Representatives from each jurisdiction will also take part in training and capacity-raising workshops that will make good use of the first-rate mining and resource education system, created by the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety. "Western Australia has a world-class system of legislation and regulation governing the mineral resources industry, and we look forward to sharing our expertise with Argentina,” the Minister said.
