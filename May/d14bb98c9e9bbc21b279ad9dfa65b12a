PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold junior Millennium Minerals has placed the first project orders for long-lead, critical path processing equipment required for the process plant expansion at its Nullagine project, in Western Australia. The A$15-million plant expansion will facilitate the treatment of sulphide resources at Nullagine, providing Millennium with the foundation to achieve its strategy of 100 000 oz/y gold production with a minimum mine life of five years. Millennium recently confirmed its preferred processing configuration for the sulphide circuit, which would involve scavenging un-leached sulphide concentrates from the existing carbon-in-leach tailings and subjecting them to ultra fine grinding and intense cyanidation to improve the leach recovery. CEO Peter Cash said on Monday that the start of the procurement process for the critical path long-lead items was another important step towards delivering Millennium’s growth strategy. “Having certainty around the timing of delivery of key capital items such as the high intensity grinding mill and spirals is an important part of our expansion strategy, and will help to ensure that we meet our project milestones,” Cash said. The expansion project is set for commissioning in the first quarter of 2019.
