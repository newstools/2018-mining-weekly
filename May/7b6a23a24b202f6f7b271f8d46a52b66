PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Despite an increase in production during the three months to April, coal miner New Hope Corporation on Tuesday reported a fall in coal sales, owing to rail outages. New Hope produced 2 102 t of coal during the quarter ended April, compared with the 2 019 t produced in the previous corresponding period, while total tonnes of coal sold was down to 1 901 t, compared to the 2 172 t sold in the previous corresponding period.
