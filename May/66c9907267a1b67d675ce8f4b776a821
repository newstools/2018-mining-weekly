JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Nicaragua-focused Condor Gold is hopeful that its redesigned mine site infrastructure that avoids the resettlement of about 1 000 people will facilitate the grant of an environmental permit for the La India gold project. The company, which is dual listed on the TSX and Aim, in February submitted a 130-page amendment to its environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) that does not require the resettlement of about 330 houses. The ESIA forms part of the environmental permit application for a 2 800 t/d processing plant, which will produce 100 000 oz/y of gold. Condor chairperson and CEO Mark Child, who formed part of the senior management team who met with an inter-institutional committee earlier this month, reported to shareholders on Tuesday that the company had held encouraging meetings with the Ministries of Environment and Natural Resources; Energy and Mines; and Forestry. “I am confident that the re-designed mine site infrastructure to avoid resettlement will facilitate the grant of the main permit,” he said. Condor has to provide additional technical information to the inter-institutional committee and has indicated that it will do so before month-end.
