DAKAR â€“ Democratic Republic of Congo's revenues from its mining sector nearly tripled in the first half of 2018 over the same period last year to $864.61-million, the finance ministry said. Revenues from the hydrocarbons sector, however, declined by a third to $67.75-million, the ministry said in a quarterly report seen by Reuters on Monday. The two sectors together account for roughly 95% of Congo's export revenues. Congo is Africa's leading copper producer and the world's top miner of cobalt, which is prized for its use in electric batteries.
