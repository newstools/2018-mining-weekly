Speciality metals producer Wolf Minerals on Thursday deferred the release of its financial statement for the year ended June 30, until it could finalise a long-term funding solution. The dual listed company, however, reported that it had made significant advances on its production reliability and profile at the Drakelands openpit mine at the Hemerdon tungsten and tin project in Devon, south-west England. As the annual report will not be published by September 28, in accordance with ASX rules, Wolf has requested a voluntary suspension from the exchange until the report is completed. Under Aim rules, the report is not due to be released until December 31. The companyâ€™s stock fell 20% in early morning trade in London, before recovering some losses to trade at 1.89p a share. The company said that work was under way to find a funding solution.
