KOLKATA (miningweekly.com) – The Indian government would not totally halt crude oil imports from Iran, but was likely to show flexibility on volumes of inward shipment as  a nuanced stance at the US-India bi-lateral engagements starting Wednesday. The Indian government reckons that that willingness to reduce crude volume imports from Iran instead of a complete halt would offer a common negotiating point at the bilateral talks between US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, US Defense Secretary,  Jim Mattis with their counterparts, India’s External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj, Defense Minister, Nirmala Sitaraman, in New Delhi starting Wednesday, the so-called 2+2 Dialogues. Indian oil imports from Iran in wake of US sanctions against the Persian Gulf nation was being anticipated at the most sticking point on the agenda and Indian officials preparing backgrounders feel that while ‘nil imports from Iran’ would definitely not be on the table as it would jeopardise the country’s energy security with Iran being the second biggest source of crude for India. However, negotiations based on India lowering inward volume shipments once US sanctions kick-in from November 4, 2018, could be the starting point of the dialogue to firm up the contours of India’s alternative crude oil sourcing  post-sanctions, officials here said. The officials said that reducing crude oil imports from Iran instead of complete stoppage would be put on the table while seeking US waivers from secondary sanctions that the US administration has proposed for any country continuing to trade with Iran once sanctions come into force. Earlier this week, the Indian government has allowed national oil refining and marketing majors to imports Iranian crude availing shipping and insurance facilities offered by Tehran as Indian national flag carrier, Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) has stopped plying to Iranian ports in response to US sanctions. Officials maintained that the Iran crude oil imports could not be permitted to be a stickler to the Dialogue agenda which has a larger aim to expand India-US strategic partnership. The US was expected to seek a larger Indian role in the former’s Indo-Pacific security architecture, joint development of military platforms, Washington’s increasing opposition to India sourcing new generation defense equipment from Russia including the Russian made S40 Triumf air defense missile platform. Given the overall strategic nature of taking India-US partnership to the next stage, with a close eye on China’s dominance in the region, Indian side would prefer the talks to focus on laying down a timeline for reduction of Iranian crude oil imports rather than US dictating a complete halt, a potential domestic political minefield for the Indian government. Interlocutors from the Indian side would put across that a progressive reduction of Iranian crude oil imports over a a longer period would be matched by higher Indian imports of oil and natural gas from the US with a commitment that such shipments from the latter would increase to $2.5-billion worth in the current year, and reinforcing the Indian government’s commitment to reduce US trade deficit with India, a high priority of the Trump Administration’s global trading priority. According to government data, Indian crude oil imports from Iran during April-July 2018 is estimated at 11.24-million ton, up 44% over corresponding months of previous year.
