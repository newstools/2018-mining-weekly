ASX-listed Neometals has appointed Jennifer Purdie and Leslie Guthrie as nonexecutive directors to its board, bringing new skills and experience to support the firm’s integrated lithium and titanium/vanadium growth strategies. Neometals will separately list its Barrambie titanium/vanadium project, in Western Australia, along with the associated technology assets. This will allow Neometals and the new company to separately focus on the development of their respective strategies. Purdie is currently the CEO of Adani Australia Renewables and Guthrie was most recently the VP of projects for BHP Billiton. Commenting on the new appointments, chairperson Steven Cole said on Thursday that Purdie and Guthrie’s respective skills aligned well with Neometals' growth strategy. “With the Neometals NewCo demerger timeline advancing well, we are pleased to have a full complement of skills to draw from to finalise the board composition for both companies,” he said.
