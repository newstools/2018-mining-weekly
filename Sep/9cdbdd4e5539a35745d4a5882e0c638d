ASX-listed Elementos has increased the Cleveland project’s tin resource estimate by 168% and the copper estimate by 164%, following a revised Joint Ore Reserve Committee study. The openpit resource now contains 17 955 t of tin and 4 624 t of copper, the owner of the Tasmania-based project reported on Wednesday. “The definition of considerably larger openpit tin and copper resource at Cleveland is an extremely positive outcome from the exploration drilling programme that was completed in the second quarter of 2018. Openpit mining studies will commence as soon as possible to determine what is expected to be a significantly positive impact on the development potential of a combined openpit mining and tailings retreatment and underground mining redevelopment at Cleveland,” said CEO Chris Creagh. The hard rock combined openpit and underground resource is 7.47-million tonnes at 0.75% tin and 0.3% copper for 56 100 t of contained tin and 22 200 t of contained copper. The total hard rock resource contained tin increased by 15.8% and the contained copper by 20%. The hard rock and tailings resource contain 67 100 t of tin and 27 200 t of copper.
