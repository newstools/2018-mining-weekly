Aim-listed GoldStone Resources is growing more confident in identifying mineral resource potential at the Akrokeri-Homase (AKHM) gold project, in Ghana. A work programme has focused on accessing the historic, high-grade Akrokeri underground gold mine, which is one of two previously producing mines within AKHM, to enable GoldStone to start assessment of the mine. The mine previously produced 75 000 oz of gold at a recovered average grade of 24 g/t gold. Drilling so far has intercepted mineralisation including 1 m at 51.01 g/t gold. GoldStone is progressing a scoping study for the proposed pits on the Homase trend and related testwork, while the Norton shaft and historic North shaft at Akrokeri mine have undergone artisanal workings. The Norton shaft has a total targeted depth of 33 m, with the bottom 3 m to accommodate a sump and pump station to allow for water to be pumped out of the mine. The North shaft workings are ongoing. The shaft is said to be 120 m deep and provides access to the levels to the historic mine workings, the extent of which are still unknown. The GoldStone team has also gained access to old artisanal workings, about 150 m north of the Norton Shaft, that sit along strike from the mineralised structure of the Akrokeri mine. These artisanal workings have opened up into shallow workings developed by the previous historic operator of the mine, between the surface and 15 m below ground. Within the area there are numerous artisanal shafts and pits and GoldStone has identified one further shaft to access the artisanal workings and is currently focused on making it safe. This will allow entry for geological evaluation, testwork and near-surface resource assessment of these shallower workings.
