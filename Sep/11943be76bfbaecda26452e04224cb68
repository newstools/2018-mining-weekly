Aim-quoted exploration and development company Chaarat Gold has appointed Robert Edwards – a mining engineer with broad institutional and corporate experience – to its board as an independent nonexecutive director. Edwards is the former chairperson of Global Mining at Renaissance Capital and has also worked for HSBC and the Royal Bank of Canada. Chaarat, which has set out to be a key consolidator of gold projects in the Commonwealth of Independent States, said that Edwards’s focus was on frontier and emerging markets. “As well as bringing deep sector knowledge, he has played a central role on multiple IPOs, capital raisings and merger and acquisition transactions," the company noted. Edwards is currently an independent nonexecutive director and member of the audit and corporate governance and remuneration committees of Nornickel, and an adviser to several private natural resource companies.
