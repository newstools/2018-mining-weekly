ASX-listed Sheffield Resources ended the week on a high note with the announcement that its Thunderbird mineral sands project, in Western Australia, is now fully permitted for development. The Australian government’s Department of the Environment and Energy has granted environmental approval for the Thunderbird project, representing the final key permit required for Thunderbird, one of the world’s largest mineral sands deposits. Earlier in the week, the company was also granted a mining lease by Western Australia’s Department of Mines, Industry, Regulation and Safety. MD Bruce McFadzean said in a statement that it had been a momentous week for Sheffield, with all key permits now secured. “We’re looking forward to developing Thunderbird, a project that will make a significant contribution to the economy and to communities throughout the Kimberley. We are ready and committed to providing long-term local employment and business opportunities and providing a significant boost to regional development.” Sheffield will produce high-grade, premium quality zircon and titanium products at Thunderbird over a 42-year mine life. Initial production is targeted in 2020.
