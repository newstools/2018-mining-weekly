LONDON - Global commodities trader Mercuria Energy Group is expanding its iron ore business with a $650-million financing package for US producer Mesabi Metallics in exchange for a majority stake in the firm, Mercuria said in a statement on Wednesday. The Geneva-based firm said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Chippewa Capital Partners that currently owns 100% of Mesabi. Mesabi has a seven-million tonne per year mine-to-plant pelletisation project in Minnesota, United States. Mercuria expects to complete the investment in the fourth quarter of this year.
