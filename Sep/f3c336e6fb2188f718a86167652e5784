PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland environmental regulator will be taking further action against a subsidiary of Indian major Adani over an unauthorised discharge of sediment water from the Abbot Point coal terminal during Cyclone Debbie, in 2017. It is alleged that Abbot Point Bulkcoal (APBC) discharged sediment water from a location called W2 that was eight times above levels authorised by the Department of Environment and Science (DES) in the temporary emissions licence (TEL). No known environmental impacts occurred as a result of the discharge. Last year, APBC contested a A$12 190 penalty infringement notice in relation to the discharge from W2. The DES has conducted a formal investigation in accordance with its usual practice, with the charge following this investigation. The maximum fine for this offence is A$2.7-million. The matter is listed for mention in the Bowen Magistrates Court on October 23. Adani was not immediately available for comment. In 2011, Adani was granted a 99-year lease at Abbot Point port and purchased the operations lease in 2016. The port currently has a 50-million-tonne capacity, and Adani is considering an expansion to 60-million tonnes. Coal from Adani’s planned Carmichael mine will be exported through this facility, once the mine becomes operational.
