West Africa-focused Toro Gold has appointed Martin Page as CFO, effective October 8. This follows the retirement of former CFO Gary Townsend, who remains available to the company on a reduced hours basis to provide continuity and support over the next 12 months. â€œI am delighted that Martin has joined our company at this exciting stage of our growth. He has highly relevant experience in West Africa gold mining and development and is ideally placed to continue the good work completed by Gary and team over the last nine years," Toro CEO Martin Horgan commented on Thursday. Toro owns the Mako gold mine, in Senegal.
