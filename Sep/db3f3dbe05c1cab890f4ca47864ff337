ASX-listed junior exploration company Tando Resources has mobilised another diamond core rig at its SPD Vanadium project, in South Africa, with three rigs now drilling out the 513-million-tonne resource. This will contribute to the publication of a Joint Ore Reserves Committee- (Jorc-) compliant measured resource for SPD by the end of October. Tando is well advanced in its strategy to establish a Jorc-compliant resource, which is part of the milestones it needs to achieve to acquire 73% of the SPD project. Other milestones include the completion of a scoping, prefeasibility and definitive feasibility study. Phase 1 of the A$1.4-million drilling programme at SPD started earlier this month and is expected to be complete before the end of the quarter. Phase 1 comprises 18 holes for 1.6 km. Phase 2, which is expected to include the drilling of 58 holes for 5.5 km, will entail upgrading the maiden Jorc-compliant resource to the indicated category. Meanwhile, drilling of the vanadium pipes within a 3 km radius of the SPD deposit will start mid-October, simultaneously with the primary drilling at SPD. Sampling of these pipes in June returned high grades of vanadium, which highlighted the potential to underpin a low-cost direct shipping ore operation for Tando. The SPD vanadium project is located in the Bushveld Complex, in South Africaâ€™s Limpopo province.
