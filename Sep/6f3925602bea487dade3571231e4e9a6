Gold producer, exploration and development company Xtract Resources, which has projects in Mozambique, on Friday said about 2 903 oz of total alluvial mining contractor gold had been produced in the six months ended June 30. Alluvial mining operations remained cash positive and progress continues to be made with monthly performance. Extract executive chairman Colin Bird noted that the period was focused entirely on the Manica concession and surrounding opportunities. “The work to consolidate the Manica area is accelerating and the possibility of including Fair Bride in the agreement is being considered. We expect [to] prepare a three-year operation plan together with costings [in the fourth quarter].” During the period, the Manica hard rock collaboration agreement was concluded with Omnia Mining. Post period end, the company announced that it had identified 12 potential mining sites within a 15 km radius of the Omnia plant.
