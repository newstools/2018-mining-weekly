Operations at the Santander zinc mine, in Peru, have been temporarily halted, owing to an illegal blockade by a group of community members claiming that the company has failed to satisfy its investment obligations. The blockade had stopped the delivery of scheduled supplies to the mine, TSX-listed Trevali Mining reported on Wednesday, adding that the blockade had been lifted and that the necessary supplies were now being delivered. Production is expected to resume within the week. “It is unfortunate that a small group of individuals chose to act in this manner instead of through open dialogue,” said Trevali president and CEO Mark Cruise. “We have enjoyed tremendous support from the local communities at Santander over the years and will continue to work diligently with the community to strengthen our commitment to a mutually beneficial relationship.” Besides the Santander mine, Trevali also owns the Caribou mine, in Canada, the Rosh Pinah mine, in Namibia and the Perkoa mine, in Burkina Faso.
