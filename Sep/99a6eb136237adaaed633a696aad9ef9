The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) has granted certificates of nonresolution to the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) regarding gold wage negotiations with Sibanye-Stillwater. The wage negotiations between the various unions and gold mining companies have been ongoing since mid-July. AMCU has also been granted a certificate of nonresolution regarding wage negotiations with Harmony Gold. Solidarity, however, agreed to Harmony’s wage offer of a 6.3% increase for 2018 and the following two years, for miners, artisans and officials, and a respective R700, R750 and R825 increase for 2018 and the following two years, for category four to eight employees. Harmony also increased the housing allowance by R100 each year for the next three years, bringing the housing allowance at the end of the period to R2 400. Although the Harmony offer of 6.3% is slightly lower than the 6.5% increase offered by AngloGold Ashanti, Solidarity said it was still a win-win that would not impair the company’s sustainability, but will reduce financial pressure on employees, since the increase is higher than the inflation rate. Meanwhile, further discussions between Sibanye and the unions will continue, since the miner reduced its 5.2% offer further to 5% on Wednesday during the CCMA meeting. Solidarity general secretary Gideon du Plessis stated that the Minerals Council has been requested to take over the negotiations, since it believes Sibanye is negotiating “in bad faith”. Harmony will meet with the NUM, UASA and Solidarity during next week. Village Main Reef will continue its engagement with unions on October 4.
