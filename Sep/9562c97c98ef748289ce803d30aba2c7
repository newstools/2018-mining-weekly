Murray & Roberts Cementation (MRC) has placed more than R160-million of mining equipment orders with Epiroc. MRC recently ordered multiple drill rigs to be used for the underground production build-up of the Kalagadi manganese mine, in the Northern Cape. The machines will ensure that the mine is operated with enhanced productivity, safety and cost efficiency. “We are happy to be a key partner to MRC as it expands productivity in the mine in the most cost efficient and safe manner possible,” Epiroc mining and infrastructure senior executive VP Helena Hedblom commented on Wednesday. MRC Northern Cape project executive Otto Fourie, meanwhile, said “MRC looks forward to building a productive and supportive relationship with Epiroc on the Kalagadi mine”. The equipment order includes Boomer 282 face drilling rigs and Boltec 235 bolting machines, as well as rock drilling tools, spare parts and on site service support.
