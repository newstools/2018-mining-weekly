Transnet Port Terminal’s (TPT’s) Saldanha iron-ore plant will shut down from September 26, as part of its yearly maintenance plan across mechanical, electrical and structural works. TPT Cape Channel GM Velile Dube states that maintenance is a critical necessity at this stage, since the facility has already handled more than 27-million tonnes of cargo this financial year. “By constantly addressing efficiency and productivity improvements through this kind of shutdown, it will further support our goal of becoming a top five terminal operator in the next five years, in line with TPT’s strategy to be recognised as a world-class logistics and freight solutions terminal operation,” Dube said. The maintenance will include redeployment of equipment where necessary, conveyor belt replacement on the stacker reclaimer, as well as bucket wheel and transfer chute repairs. Some of the other areas that will undergo major maintenance work are Ship Loader 1 chute repairs, with tiling and structural bolt replacements and repairs, dust plant filter replacements and yearly fire suppression tests. Boasting the largest natural, deep-water port in South Africa, TPT’s Saldanha terminal has an average draft of 17.5 across its combined five berths with an ability to accommodate Panamax and Cape-sized vessels. The terminal remains the largest iron-ore export facility in Africa, loading between 21 and 32 vessels a month.
