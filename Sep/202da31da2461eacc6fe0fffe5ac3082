NYSE-listed Coeur Mining on Monday reported that two workers had died at its Palmarejo silver/gold mine, in Mexico, the previous week. The company explained that two underground production drillers fell into a void after the ground below them collapsed. The area was evacuated and all underground operations were suspended pending emergency response and initial investigation. Coeur said that ground collapse occurred in a highly localised area and that it did not affect other portions of the mine. Operations have resumed except in the specific level of the underground mine where the incident occurred. “On behalf of everyone here at Coeur Mining, I want to express our condolences to the families, friends and communities of the employees we have lost in this tragic accident,” commented president and CEO Mitchell Krebs. A formal investigation has begun to determine the root causes of the incident.
