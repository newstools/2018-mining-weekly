Diamond mining company BlueRock Diamonds has achieved an 81% increase year-on-year increase in production at its Kareevlei diamond mine, in the Kimberley region, to 73 028 t for the six months ended June 30. This represents an active period for the company, culminating in the restabilisation of production, which is now approaching 1 500 t/d. This was also achieved while contending with the seasonal downturn owing to the rainy season always experienced in the first half of each year, aggravated by the now rectified crusher fault which resulted in a halt in production in June. Modifications continue on the crushing circuit following the installation of a second cone crusher to achieve the required consistencies and to begin to create the stockpile necessary to lessen the rainy season impact. Turnover increased by 269% to £556 000, while losses reduced to £789 000. During the six months, production started at the second kimberlite pipe KV1, which has a 40% higher inferred mineral resource grade than KV2. Average grade continues to increase, with the average for the period at 3.17 carats per hundred tonnes. The average value per carat remains steady at $340, with Kareevlei ranking in the top ten kimberlite mines in the world. The development work being conducted at KV2 will provide good-quality high-grade kimberlite in 2019.
