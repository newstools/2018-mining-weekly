Canada’s Alacer Gold has started processing oxide ore through the crushing and grinding circuit of the newly constructed Çöpler sulphide plant, in Turkey. The remainder of the plant, including the acidulation, pressure oxidation and counter current decantation, will be started once the sulphide circuit is complete and the oxide circuit is fully operational and stabilised, the TSX- and ASX-listed gold producer said on Tuesday. The Çöpler mine, in central-eastern Turkey, has been operating since 2010, processing oxide ore through a heap-leach operation. The oxide ore is progressively being exhausted and the mine is shifting to processing sulphide ore using pressure oxidation. This will expand the operation’s mine life to 2037. Alacer’s 2018 forecast for Çöpler is to produce 70 000 oz to 90 000 oz of oxide ore and 50 000 oz to 100 000 oz of sulphide ore, at an all-in sustaining cost of $750/oz to $800/oz for the oxides only.
