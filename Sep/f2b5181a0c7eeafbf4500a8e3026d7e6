Mining-focussed investment adviser Appian Capital Advisory has appointed Trevor Reid to its senior advisory board. Prior to this appointment, Reid was CFO at mining company Xstrata and served as the CFO and FD from 2002. Prior to joining Xstrata, he was Standard Bank resource banking global head, and was responsible for all natural resources trading, lending and advisory activities of the group. The announcement follows the recent appointment of Mark Barnaba to Appian’s senior advisory board. Along with the two new appointees, Appian’s existing senior advisory board includes former BHP Billiton CEO Chip Goodyear, former JP Morgan vice chairperson and UK diplomat Lord Robin Renwick and investor Len Baker. “[Reid’s] appointment adds yet another high-calibre individual to the advisory board and will provide further financial and operational experience across a wide range of commodities and regions,” Appian CEO Michael Scherb commented on Tuesday.
