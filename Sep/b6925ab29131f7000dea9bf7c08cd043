The Angolan Ministry of Mineral Resources and Petroleum has gazetted a new mineral investment contract for the Lulo kimberlite exploration licence, covering a five-year period through to April 30, 2023. Lucapa Diamond Company co-owns and operates the kimberlite  exploration programme on the highly prospective 3 000 km2 Lulo concession, which is run in parallel with the high-value alluvial diamond mining activities, conducted via Sociedade Mineira Do Lulo. Lucapa and its partners, Empresa Nacional de Diamantes and Rosas & Petalas have established a systematic year-round kimberlite drilling programme, which aims to  identify  the  primary  hard-rock  source,  or  sources,  of  the  exceptional  large  and  high-value  alluvial diamonds currently being recovered proximal to the kimberlite targets at Lulo. Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall posited that this gazetting was further evidence of Angola’s  diamond  sector reforms and the strong working relationship between Lucapa and its Angolan partners.
