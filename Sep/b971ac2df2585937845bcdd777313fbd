MC Mining plans to follow due process to have a fresh appeal against an environmental authorisation (EA) for its Makhado hard coking and thermal coal project dismissed. The appeal by what MC described as a “narrow interest group” has resulted in the suspension of the amended EA. The company announced on September 3 that it had received approval from the Limpopo Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism for an amendment to the project’s EA, for the transport of coal to the Musina rail siding by road rather than rail. The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) subsequently also approved the amended EA for the project. MC on Friday said the appeal was lodged by the same group that had previously unsuccessfully appealed against the DMR’s original Makhado EA.
