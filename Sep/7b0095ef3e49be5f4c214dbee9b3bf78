ASX- and JSE-listed Orion Minerals’ Prieska project drill-out programme is nearing completion, with continued high-grade results being returned at the deep sulphide target. The company has drilled more than 83 000 m since May 2017, across 94 intersections, including 15 intersections drilled for metallurgical testwork on the deep sulphide target. The Prieska zinc/copper project is situated in South Africa’s Northern Cape. The company aims to reopen the mine in 2020. It has a total mineral resource of 29.4-million tonnes for 1.13-million tonnes of zinc and 360 000 t of copper. Eight diamond drill rigs remain deployed at Prieska for infill drilling to increase sample density in the deep sulphide target, with the objective of getting an updated mineral resource estimate, including an upgrade in resource categories, in the fourth quarter. Additionally, Orion has started near-mine exploration with data assimilation and interpretation, mapping and ground electromagnetic surveys to identify an early priority target at the Annex copper deposit.
