The Tanzania Ministry of Minerals has recommended the two mining licence applications covering the Bunya graphite project for approval, ASX-listed Volt Resources reported on Friday. The two mining licence applications cover the footprint for the Stage 1 and Stage 2 developments at Bunya. The Stage 1 development is based on a mining and processing plant throughput rate of 40 000 t/y of ore to produce on average 23Â 700 t/y of graphite products. The main objective of this development is to establish infrastructure and market position in support of a significantly larger expansion at a later stage.
