Trade union Solidarity is of the view that petrochemicals giant Sasol now finds itself on the wrong side of Mining Charter 3, which was gazetted this week. According to the charter, employees must share in company shareholding and all employees must benefit from employee share ownership plans. “As such, the charter does not make a distinction between employees based on race,” said Solidarity CE Dr Dirk Hermann. He added that, as Sasol is part of the mining industry, it has to comply with the charter. “If Sasol does not amend its Khanyisa employee share ownership plan [which excludes white employees] then they are not observing the consensus achieved between parties in the mining industry.” Solidarity and Sasol will meet again at the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration on October 3, at which time Solidarity will request that the dispute between the parties be resolved within the definition of the Mining Charter. Meanwhile, Hermann announced planning was under way for a big march to Sasol’s head office, in Sandton, Gauteng.
