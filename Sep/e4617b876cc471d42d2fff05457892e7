Danish geologist Dr Bo Stensgaard has joined Bluejay Mining to strengthen the existing team focusing on delivering the world’s highest-grade ilmenite project – Dundas, in Greenland. Stensgard has been appointed GM of Bluejay in a nonboard role, but will serve on the subsidiary boards as executive director of Dundas Titanium and Disko Exploration. His responsibilities will include strengthening the existing executive team focusing on delivery at Dundas and managing the European and Greenlandic government agency liaison. “Bo's experience, geological knowledge, network and understanding of Greenland make him the ideal person to join us as we advance the Dundas project into production. In support of this, Bo will initially focus on working with the existing feasibility team to submit and secure the exploitation licence ahead of planned mining. Our ability to attract someone of Bo's calibre is testament to the quality of our operation and its value creation potential,” said Bluejay CEO Roderick McIllree. The Dundas project is at an advanced stage and has a total resource of 96-million tonnes at 6.9% ilmenite. This includes the newly identified area of mineralisation at Iterlak Delta, where Bluejay is currently undertaking an exploration programme. The company aims to establish a mining operation by 2019 and is busy completing studies to support this goal. Last month, Bluejay appointed well-known resource investor, Ian Henderson, as a nonexecutive director to promote the company and the Dudas project to the international mining investment industry.
