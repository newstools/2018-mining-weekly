Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds, which owns and operates the Kareevlei diamond mine, nearly Kimberley, in the Northern Cape, has started kimberlite processing from the KV1 pipe – the mine’s second kimberlite pipe. KV1 is one of five known kimberlite pipes within the Kareevlei project area and has an inferred mineral resource grade of 6.3 carats per hundred tonnes (cpht), which is 40% greater than that of the 4.5 cpht KV2 pipe where processing commenced in 2014. “I’m delighted that processing from KV1 is now under way which is anticipated to increase the overall grade, allowing for greater flexibility in production and more consistent results. “With our crushing circuit now processing at or around the target production levels of 80 t/h, the outlook for the remainder of 2018 is looking positive. I look forward to providing a further update in our [third-quarter] production report due in early October 2018,” CEO Adam Waugh commented on Tuesday.
