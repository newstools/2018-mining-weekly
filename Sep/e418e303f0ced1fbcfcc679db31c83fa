Queensland miner New Century Resources has started stockpiling zinc concentrate in its 80 000 t storage shed at the Karumba port, paving the way for exports to start and first revenue to be received this month. “The successful refurbishment and restart of activities at New Century’s port facility is a great achievement for the company and an exciting development for the town of Karumba,” New Century port manager Greg O’Shea said on Wednesday. New Century is extracting zinc concentrate from tailings waste at Lawn Hill and will transport the zinc slurry using a 304 km pipeline to the port in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The tailings project was officially opened last week, with 15-million tonnes a year to be extracted.
