Triple-listed Europa Metals has initiated a change of land use process to facilitate the potential future development of its Toral lead/zinc/silver project, in northern Spain. The company has engaged consultancy MAGMA Soluciones Ambientales to progress the requisite land use applications across three municipalities overlapping the Toral licence area. The process is expected to take about 18 months. Europa Metals is currently in the first year of its three-year investigation permit for Toral, but executive director Laurence Read said on Thursday that there was sufficient confidence in the asset to begin the change of land use process. “Adhering to all the relevant permissions and safeguards is an important and essential part of delivering new mining operations in Europe and now is the right time to begin this process,” he commented in a statement. The project is currently the subject of a scoping study.
