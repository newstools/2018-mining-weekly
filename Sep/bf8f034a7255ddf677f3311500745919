The first shipment of ore has left the Plomosas zinc/lead/silver project for processing at Grupo Mexico’s Santa Eulalia plant, ASX-listed Consolidated Zinc reported on Thursday. The company said it would deliver about 100 t/d to the concentrator for the rest of the month, whereafter it would scale up operations to more than 10 000 t/m in the next nine months. The Plomosas mine, in Mexico, has been brought back into operation using local contractors and staff. “We are pleased that our Mexican team established mining operations on time, under budget and in a safe manner. There is great potential at Plomosas and this cash flow from early production has created the financial means to begin unlocking that potential,” commented Consolidated Zinc CEO Brad Marwood.
