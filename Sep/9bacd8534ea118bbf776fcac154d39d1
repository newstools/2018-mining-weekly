PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Potash hopeful Kalium Lakes has reported a 150% increase in the measured and indicated resources at its Beyondie sulpate of potash (SoP) project, in Western Australia. The project is now estimated to host a measured and indicated resource of 1.72-million tonnes, an indicated resource of 9.17-million tonnes and an inferred resource of 7.79-million tonnes. Kalium Lakes MD Brett Hazelden said that the additional hydrogeological data collected this year has resulted in a considerable increase to the measured and indicated resource classifications. “This increase is anticipated to translate into a substantial increase in ore reserves, with an update scheduled during September. It is also likely that we will be able to increase the mine life, which will, in turn, generate additional opportunities to increase our production rates.” Kalium Lakes recently had its mining proposal and closure plan for Beyondie approved. Beyondie is expected to produce 150 000 t/y SoP, with the option to incrementally phase the project through a ramp-up from 75 000 t/y to 150 000 t/y SoP to minimise operational and financial risks. The project is expected to cost some A$220-million to develop.
