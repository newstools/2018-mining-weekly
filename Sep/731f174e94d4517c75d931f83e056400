The environmental review period of the Yangibana project is set to open next week, allowing the public 28 days to comment on the planned rare earth minerals mine in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia. The environmental review document will be available for comment from October 1 to 28, project developer Hastings Technology Metals reported on Thursday. The Sydney-based company is advancing the Yangibana rare earths project towards production, following the completion of a positive definitive feasibility study (DFS) in November. The DFS established a probable ore reserve of 5.15-million tonnes at 1.12% total rare earths oxides, including 41% neodymium and praseoudymium oxides. The planned production rate for the mine is 15Â 000 t/y of mixed-rare earth carbonate.
