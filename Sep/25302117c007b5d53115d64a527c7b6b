JSE- and NYSE-listed Gold Fields has again been ranked the top South African mining company on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) benchmarking database. The DJSI scorecard for 2018, which was published on Thursday, shows that Gold Fields’ sustainability practices rank with the best of resources companies worldwide, being ranked fourth among 60 mining companies assessed and the third best global gold company. The company has participated in the DJSI assessment, which is carried out by investment firm RobecoSAM on behalf of the DJSI, since 2000. The DJSI was launched in 1999 and ranks the performance of global sustainability leaders through a yearly assessment of the world’s 4 000 largest public companies. The DJSI measures a range of management practices surrounding economic, environmental and social engagement approaches. These include issues such as commitment to and reporting on corporate governance, climate strategy, water-related risks, human rights and social impacts on communities. "Our continued strong performance on the DJSI shows that we are on the right track in terms of fully integrating sustainability into our business, but there always will be areas of improvement, particularly in further strengthening our relations with impacted host communities," commented Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland. “Companies that compete for a coveted place in the DJSI challenge themselves to continuously improve their sustainability practices and we are pleased to see that the number of companies that commit to achieving measurable positive impacts continues to rise,” said RobecoSAM environmental, social and governance ratings head Manjit Jus.
