TSX-listed RNC Minerals has awarded a contract to Ausenco Engineering Canada to update the feasibility study for the Dumont nickel/cobalt project, in Quebec, with results set to be announced in the first half of next year. The feasibility study update will maintain the same project scope, flowsheet, and overall site layout from the feasibility study completed in July 2013, but will incorporate the results of the recently completed market value-in-use study, updated macroeconomic assumptions and several other optimisations and updates, including an updated mine plan, optimisation of tailings deposition, and updated capital and operating costs. Ausenco has led all the earlier prefeasibility and feasibility studies completed on the project. Ausenco, in conjunction with Duro Fulguera, also completed additional engineering work in 2015 to develop an engineering, procurement and construction lump sum turnkey proposalÂ for about 72% of the capital cost. "We are very pleased to work again with the high calibre team from Ausenco and supporting engineering firms to complete the feasibility study update as we work toward our goal of making a construction decision in 2019," RNC CEO Mark Selby said. The company hopes to produce nickel and cobalt from Dumont by the early 2020s. RNC has a 28% interest in the joint venture with Waterton that owns the Dumont project, in the Abitibi region.
