The Authier lithium project in Quebec, Canada, has the potential to enter into production in 2020, producing 1.58-million tonnes a year of spodumene concentrate over 18 years, project developer Sayona Mining reported this week. Announcing the outcomes of the definitive feasibility study (DFS), MD Dan O’Neill said that the clean energy revolution was driving demand for new lithium projects, such as Authier, noting that the mine would be relatively close to key US markets, including the Tesla factory in Nevada. The mine, which will require start-up capital of $89.9-million, is based on a current proven and probable ore reserve estimate of 12.10-million tonnes at 1% lithium oxide, at a 0.55% cutoff grade. The DFS delivered a net present value of C$184.8-million, a pretax internal rate of return of 33.7% and the payback on capital is 2.6 years. Sayona is exploring three options for selling the spodumene concentrates: exporting concentrates through a Quebec port and selling it to Chinese lithium carbonate processing facility, selling concentrates into the Quebec domestic market, where downstream facilities are planned, or processing and producing lithium carbonate/hydroxide product through an integrated downstream processing facility. Sayona has completed a concept study assessing the viability of constructing a downstream plant and is undertaking testwork as part of a prefeasibility study to consider lithium carbonate and hydroxide. The Authier property is located in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region near the towns of Val-d’Or and Amos.
